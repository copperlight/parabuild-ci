Cacheonix caching technology
Enterprise level caching technology is a key component of Cacheonix's software products in the SOA and CEP segments. Implementing an associative memory model for parallel/distributed computing, it provides a repository of tuples that can be accessed concurrently. Producers post their data as tuples in the model, and the consumers then retrieve data that match certain patterns in a peer-to-peer manner.

Cacheonix's caching technology provides an in-memory data grid solution for enterprise business solutions. It enables our customers to use Cacheonix products to build predictably scaleable mission-critical applications with fast access to frequently used data, dynamically partitioned across multiple servers. Cacheonix's enterprise caching technology ensures continuous data availability and transactional integrity even in the event of server failure by adding nodes on the fly as the situation demands. Customers can develop their business applications with an easy to use API based on JCache and JINI technology.  Cacheonix's enterprise caching technology facilitates the seamless integration of the Cacheonix SOA and CEP platforms.
