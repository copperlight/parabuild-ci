pv.exe – PrcView command line utility allows automating common task like 
figuring out if particular process is running or killing a running process 
on scheduler.

Checking if  a particular process is running is easy. For example the 
following command will show all instances of explorer that are running:
	pv explorer.exe

Setting a process priority is another common task. To set explorer priority 
to normal just type:
	pv –pn explorer.exe
or if you like a ‘verbose’ style
	pv -p"Normal" explorer.exe

pv supports the common ‘*’ and ‘?’ wildcards so that the following command 
will perfectly work by printing out all the processes starting with ‘e’
	pv  e*

Don’t like a particular process and would like to kill it? The following 
command will do the job:
	pv –k thisprocess.exe 

And if you don’t like additional questions and would like to force killing:
	pv –kf  thisprocess.exe

Don’t like this particular instance of the process and know the window title? 
The following command will do the job (please note that ‘\’ need to be 
represented as a ‘\\’ combination if  you enter it from the command line):
	pv -k thisprocess.exe -w"c:\\"

pv.exe can be easealy executed from a batch file to check if process is running. 
When writing a command file please note that the ERRORLEVEL number specifies 
a true condition if the last program run returned an exit code equal to or 
_greater_ than the number specified. 

The following script illustrates how this could be done:

@echo off
pv.exe %1 >nul
if ERRORLEVEL 1 goto Process_NotFound
:Process_Found
echo Process %1 is running
goto END
:Process_NotFound
echo Process %1 is not running
goto END
:END

Please note that redirecting standard errors by using 2>file_name does not work under 9x 
Windows. Please use "2>file_name" instead. This notation will be processed by pv.exe.

And finally a copy of the -? command:

Examples:
  pv myprocess.exe        get process ID for myprocess.exe.
  pv -e                   get extended list of running processes.
  pv -k sleep*            kill all processes starting with "sleep"
  pv -m -e explorer.exe   get extended information about explorer's modules
  pv -u oleaut*.dll       list of all processes that use matching dll
