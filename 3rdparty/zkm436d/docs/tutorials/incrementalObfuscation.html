         <h1>Change Logs and Incremental Obfuscation</h1>
         <h3>Change Logs</h3>
         <a href="../chnglg1.html">Change&nbsp;logs</a> record the mapping of:
         <ul>
            <li>old names to new names,
            <li>original source line numbers to scrambled line numbers (if you used Line&nbsp;Number&nbsp;Scrambling),
            <li>flow obfuscation data (if you used flow&nbsp;obfuscation).
         </ul>
         You should always let Zelix KlassMaster produce a change log when you perform your final obnfuscation and then store it a safe place.
         You will need it:
         <ul>
            <li>to translate any stack trace you might get if your bytecode contains some bugs,
            <li>to use as an <a href="#inputChangeLog">input change log</a> when you obfuscate future releases so that objects are consistently renamed.
                This is called <a href="#incrementalObfuscation">incremental obfuscation</a>.
         </ul>
This is the kind of stack trace you may get from an obfuscated application.
<pre>
java.lang.NullPointerException: 
        at a.a.b.gp.a(gp.java:101)
        at a.a.b.gp.a(gp.java:457)
        at a.a.b.gp.b(gp.java:13)
        at a.a.b.gp.a(gp.java:501)
        at a.a.b.b.a(b.java:4)
        at a.a.b.b.a(b.java:98)
        at Main.main(Main.java:433)
</pre>
         Without the change log that was produced when the application was obfuscated, the stack trace will be close to indecipherable. 
         Note that if you have a change log, you can use the <a href="../toolsStackTraceTranslate.html">Stack Trace Translate</a> tool to help you decipher stack traces.
         
         <h3><a name="inputChangeLog">Input Change Logs</a></h3>
          You can specify that a change log should be used as a guide when assigning new names to packages, classes, fields and methods. 
          When a change log is used in this way it is refered to as an <b>input change log</b>.  
          Input change logs are the basis of Zelix KlassMaster's <a href="#incrementalObfuscation">incremental obfuscation</a>.
          <p>
          When you are using the ZKM Script <a href="../obfuscateStatement.html">obfuscate</a> statement, you can specify more than one input change log.
          If more than one input change log is specified then the change logs are effectively merged. 
          Change logs appearing first in the list have precedence over those appearing later in the list. 
          <p>
          By default, Zelix KlassMaster will honour the mappings in an input change log and it will give those mappings precedence over 
          any name obfuscation exclusion settings that may be in place.  So input change log mappings overrule your exclusion settings.
          This strictness is essential for incremental obfuscation.
          <p>
          However, the <a href="../obfuscateStatement.html">obfuscate</a> statement also allows you to specify "loose" input change logs.  
          An input change log is specified as "loose" if the <code>looseChangeLogFileIn</code> rather than the <code>changeLogFileIn</code> parameter
          is used with the <a href="../obfuscateStatement.html">obfuscate</a> statement. Loose input change logs are different in that your exclusion settings
          take precedence over the change log mappings. They are typically only usefull when you need to produce a slightly different for some special purpose.
          They are not suitable for <a href="#incrementalObfuscation">incremental obfuscation</a> because the slight changes that can result
          could break compatability with previous releases.

         <h3><a name="incrementalObfuscation">Incremental Obfuscation</a></h3>
         Incremental Obfuscation is the ability to consistently obfuscate subsequent versions of your bytecode such that:
         <ul>
            <li>the same new names are assigned to each particular package, class, field and method in all releases,
            <li>flow obfuscation is consistent across releases.
         </ul>
         This consistency is necessary:
         <ul>
            <li>for Java Serialization support,
            <li>if you wish to release just a subset of your application's classes in the form of a patch.
         </ul>
         <p>
         Zelix KlassMaster supports incremental obfuscation through its <a href="#inputChangeLog">input change log</a> functionality.  
         The change log generated when the previous version was obfuscated must be specified as the input change log when the next release
         is obfuscated.  However, note that:
         <ul>
            <li>you must always open and obfuscate <b>all</b> of the classes of your application even if you intend to release just the changed subset,
            <li>you should be careful that your output and input change logs have different names so that one does not overwrite the other.
         </ul>
