<h1>1.0 <a name="RoboReadme1"></a>Defects Fixed in Version Manager 8.1.0</h1>


<h2>1.1 <a name="RoboReadme2"></a>Desktop Client, CLI, PCLI, and DTK Defects Fixed</h2>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">UNIX:  Screen updates are very slow with remote X displays [38142]</h3>

<p class="sub">When the Version Manager desktop client opens on a remote X Windows display, screen updates can take a very long time.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Project tree view occasionally collapses [38949, 41229]</h3>

<p class="sub">After you perform certain operations in the project pane of the Version Manager desktop client, the project pane occasionally collapses, requiring you to browse back to your original project.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">vsplit command fails on an archive named <span class="syntax"><i>fileName</i>.$$$-arc</span> [40936]</h3>

<p class="sub">The default semaphore suffix used by <span class="syntax">vsplit</span> (<span class="syntax">??$</span>) results in a failure when you try to split an archive that has a dollar sign (<span class="syntax">$</span>) in the file-name suffix.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.  The <span class="syntax">vsplit</span> command now supports the <span class="syntax">-C</span> option, which you can use to pass the command a configuration file that redefines the semaphore suffix to be used (for example, <span class="syntax">SemSuffix = +-sem</span>).  For more information, see the <span class="syntax">SemSuffix</span> directive in the <i>Serena ChangeMan Version Manager Command-Line Reference Guide</i>.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">File server returns an error when an event trigger is called from a UNIX client [40937]</h3>

<p class="sub">When an event trigger executed from a UNIX client tries to access a file on a File Server (for example, through a CLI command), that trigger fails with a SOAP FAULT message.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Long convoluted sentence in the admin guide [71355]</h3>

<p class="sub">The description of the different types of configuration files is somewhat confusing.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Differencing tool reports some binary files as being the same when they are not [31714]</h3>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">UNIX:  TRANSLATE prevents &quot;unchanged&quot; prompt from appearing [38934]</h3>

<p class="sub">If TRANSLATE is on, the &quot;unchanged&quot; prompt does not appear on Unix.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">VTRANSFER -r (UNIX):  Changing the case of a file name on a case-insensitive File Server results in loss of the archive [72245]</h3>

<p class="sub">When <span class="syntax">vtransfer -r</span> is used only to change the case of the name of an archive, it can result in the loss of the archive.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">UNIX:  Unexpected File Server case-sensitivity sometimes causes archives not to appear [72892, 73070]</h3>

<p class="sub">A UNIX File Server configured to be case-insensitive sometimes treats an archve in a case-sensitive manner.  Such archives are temporarily unavailable to the Version Manager clients.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">VM Web Application Server seemingly shuts down at random [74459]</h3>

<p class="sub">The VM Web Application Server process used to provide the File Server, the Version Manager Web Server, and WebDAV services sometimes shuts down on Windows systems when someone logs off from that system's console.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">DBCS File Server:  VSQL and VSPLIT Use 100% of the CPU [75544]</h3>

<p class="sub">Attempts to run <span class="syntax">vsplit</span> or <span class="syntax">vsql</span> against a DBCS (double-byte character set) archive on a File Server locks up those commands.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Vss2VM converter no longer works in 8.0.2.x [72539]</h3>

<p class="sub">In Version Manager 8.0.2.x, the Visual SourceSafe convertor fails with the message &quot;ERROR:  PVCS_E_ACCESS_DENIED".  This has been fixed.</p>


<h2>1.2 <a name="RoboReadme3"></a>VM Web Client Defects Fixed</h2>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Check-out by version label fails if the label contains a space [40565]</h3>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Cannot view or edit a file from the Revision pane if the file name contains a single quotation mark [40977]</h3>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Cannot view or edit a file if the file name contains an ampersand (<span class="syntax">&amp;</span>) [40978]</h3>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Version Manager Web Server does not read embedded master configuration files [73141]</h3>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Tomcat exposes potential vulnerabilities [74087]</h3>

<p class="sub">Some of the default configurations in the Tomcat server used by Version Manager can expose potential vulnerablilities.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed by switching to Tomcat 5 and by modifying and removing vulnerable configurations.</p>


<h2>1.3 <a name="RoboReadme4"></a>IDE Client Defects Fixed</h2>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Error occurs when an @ sign is used in the Description field to specify a message file [22203]</h3>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">No method to promote a revision to the next promotion group or to manage promotion groups [22048]</h3>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.  For details, see the online help for the new promotion dialog boxes.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Configuring File Server to allow HTTPS (SSL) connections results in corrupted connection string [22172]</h3>

<p class="sub">When an <span class="syntax">https:</span> connection string is specified to connect to the File Server, the IDE integration prefixes that string with <span class="syntax">http:</span>.  This makes it impossible for the IDE integration to connect to the File Server via HTTPS.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>




<hr size="2" width="100%" noshade>


<h1>2.0 <a name="RoboReadme5"></a>Defects Fixed in Version Manager 8.0.2.3</h1>


<h2>2.1 <a name="RoboReadme6"></a>Desktop Client, CLI, PCLI, and DTK Defects Fixed</h2>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Users receive an A: drive error while browsing the local file system [37293]</h3>

<p class="sub">When using the browse capability for local file systems or when trying to open a project database, some users receive the following error:  &quot;There is no disk in the drive.  Please insert a disk into drive <span class="syntax">A:</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>


<h2>2.2 <a name="RoboReadme7"></a>VM Web Client Defects Fixed</h2>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Clicking on a file browse button sometimes causes a Java exception [22460]</h3>

<p class="sub">Clicking the file browse button in any Version Manager web client dialog box can cause an error message to appear in the Java Console referring to an <span class="syntax">A:</span> drive security problem.  In that case, the browse dialog box does not open.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>




<hr size="2" width="100%" noshade>


<h1>3.0 <a name="RoboReadme8"></a>Defects Fixed in Version Manager 8.0.2.0</h1>


<h2>3.1 <a name="RoboReadme9"></a>Desktop Client, CLI, PCLI, and DTK Defects Fixed</h2>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI maintains multiple TCP/IP connections to the license server for a single user ID and session [1048543]</h3>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Mouse wheel doesn't work in some VM versions [4000040]</h3>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.  Wheel mice now work correctly in the desktop client, and they work in any web client that uses version 1.4.1 or higher of the Jave Runtime Environment (JRE).</p>

<h1>21.0 <a name="RoboReadme60"></a>Defects Fixed in Version Manager 7.5.1.0</h1>

<h2>21.1 <a name="RoboReadme61"></a>Version Manager GUI, CLI, PCLI, and DTK Defects Fixed</h2>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI Does Not Create Archives That Have German Characters in the File Name [1031395]</h3>

<p class="sub">On Windows, if a CodePage other than 1252 is used, the German umlaut characters are not displayed correctly.  This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="sub"><b>NOTE:</b>  You can change or query your CodePage from a Command Prompt using the command <span class="syntax">chcp</span>.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Double-Clicking a Project with No Permissions Locks the GUI [1023776]</h3>

<p class="sub">If a user is not defined in the access control database for a project and that user double-clicks a project to open it, the GUI locks up and displays the error message:  "Access to this project has been denied because your login account is invalid".  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Version Manager 7.5.0.0 Hangs When You Try to Rename a Promotion Group to an Existing Group [1037855]</h3>

<p class="sub">If you enter the name of an existing promotion group in an attempt to rename that promotion group using Configure Project, the GUI gets stuck in a loop and locks up.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">No PCLI Option to Turn Off Header Banner [1003330]</h3>

<p class="sub">There was no way to turn off the display of the Banner Header when running a PCLI command.  This is now possible by passing PCLI the option <span class="syntax">-nb</span> (No Banner), or by assigning a value to the environment variable <span class="syntax">PVCS_NO_BANNER</span>.  This new environment variable is honored by all Version Manager commands.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Certain Command-Line Executables Did Not Use the nfsmap File [222505]</h3>

<p class="sub">The nfsmap file is not used by the command-line executables <span class="syntax">vcompress</span>, <span class="syntax">vdel</span>, <span class="syntax">vdiff</span>, <span class="syntax">vsql</span>, <span class="syntax">readdb</span>, and <span class="syntax">makedb</span>.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Put Does Not Check the Workfile Name if the User has Locked an Archive and Checked Something Different In [1002176]</h3>

<p class="sub">If you merely lock an archive, rather than doing a checkout with a lock, and then browse to a different file at check-in, Version Manager checks in the file without a warning.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">User Cannot Check In Multiple Files That Were Checked Out to Different Locations [1014389]</h3>

<p class="sub">If you check out files in a project to different locations, either manually or by using different workspaces, you cannot check them in as a group; Version Manager defaults to the workfile location for the project and does not use the check-out location embedded in the archive.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Pinned Files Return "specifies a version number, which is illegal" Error When Using Version Manager with VSS [1019336]</h3>

<p class="sub">The command <span class="syntax">ss dir &#36;/pinned</span> returns a list of items in the project specified.  When a file is pinned, the file name is returned with a semicolon and a number to append to it.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">No PCLI Command to Promote or Assign Promotion Group [1032167]</h3>

<p class="sub">In previous versions of Version Manager, it was nearly impossible to promote a revision or assign a promotion group from within a PCLI script.  The commands AssignGroup, ChangeGroup, DeleteGroup and PromoteGroup have been added to PCLI to fix this.  See the readme file for a description and syntax of these commands.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Wrong Workfile Location Used When One User Checks Out the Same Revision Twice [1032683, 1036485]</h3>

<p class="sub">If a file was checked out using the root workspace setting, then the user switched to a new workspace and checked the file out again, Version Manager produced two locks with workfiles in different locations.  When checking in the file, Version Manager did not know which workspace was used to check out the archive and might check in the wrong version.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Quotation Marks Around Name Used Literally in PCLI [1035591]</h3>

<p class="sub">The PCLI DeleteUser and AddUser commands takes any quotation marks around a name, making it impossible to create or delete certain valid names.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Journal File Entries for "modify change description" Truncated to 200 Bytes [1036160]</h3>

<p class="sub">If you modify an existing change description, the journal file entry is limited to 200 characters.  This produces errors when you run the journal report causing, in some cases, an "Unknown Exception" error.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Typing Filename (base) in Add Workfiles From Field Will Create Project [1036310]</h3>

<p class="sub">When a user types a file basename (a name without a path) in the From field of the Add Workfiles dialog box, Version Manager creates a project with the name of that file.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Problem Converting Archives from VSS to Version Manager when Multiple Branches were Deleted [1036609, 1036626]</h3>

<p class="sub">If branch revisions between the trunk and tip are deleted, the trunk is not able to attach itself to a branch.  The VSS Converter tool is unable to build a branch.  This has been fixed.
</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">How to Disable the New Banner and Help Page Buttons, "What's New" and "What's Coming" [1037716]</h3>

<p class="sub">Tracker and Version Manager automatically pop up marketing messages in the What's New and What's Coming topics after a fresh installation.  It is possible to turn off these help messages.  Contact Answerline for assistance.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Embedded Disallow Directives Appended to Every Configuration File [1020757]</h3>

<p class="sub">When users made changes to the configuration files, disallow statements were appended to the configuration file.  The customer would need to remove the disallow statements that were appended to the configuration file, but when a change was made, the disallow statements were appended again.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Project Metadata Directory (P*.prj) Not Always Moved When the Project is Moved [1038161]</h3>

<p class="sub">Version Manager on Windows platforms could fail a project move operation because the directory being moved was "in use", resulting in error messages such as:  "Could not rename "\\server\share\...\old_dir\P2tkjy.prj" to "\\server\share\...\new_dir\P2tkjy.prj".  This has been fixed.</p>

<h2>21.2 <a name="RoboReadme62"></a>VM I-Net Defects Fixed</h2>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Incorrect Setup of iPlanet 6.0 Files After Server Configuration Utility [1037641]</h3>

<p class="sub">If iPlanet 6.0 files are set up incorrectly, users would receive Init links in the wrong file and partial tag definitions.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">File Does Not Exist &lt;path&gt;BKGRD.gif [1008398]</h3>

<p class="sub">The web server error log recorded the error:  "file does not exist &lt;path&gt;BKGRD.gif".  This file was called by a number of pages and the log could grow very large affecting performance.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">VM I-Net Default Version Does Not Work for Diff if Floating Label [1037274]</h3>

<p class="sub">VM I-Net would produce the error:  "Could not find a revision assigned with the version label, 1.*, in the archive &lt;path&gt;&lt;file name-arc&gt;"  when users would try to run a diff report.  This has been fixed.
</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">VM I-Net Gets 404 Error When Trying to Get to a PDB [1035955]</h3>

<p class="sub">When you use Apache with VM I-Net, the attempt to hit the servlet or "install program" generates a segmentation violation in the active Apache thread.  It reports the error:  "[warn] Loaded DSO &lt;Pathname_to_mod_jk&gt; uses plain Apache 1.3 API, this module might crash under EAPI! (please recompile it with -DEAPI)"</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">VM I-Net Project Names Not Visible with Certain Display Settings [1036467]</h3>

<p class="sub">If a user's workstation display settings were set to "high contrast black", the names of the projects were not visible with the black background.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Regarding the mod_jk Connector [1037918]</h3>

<p class="sub">A user may connect to the target machine and deliver several requests with invalid chunked coded body.  VM I-Net now includes mod_jk 1.2.1, which no longer suffers from this problem.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">pvcsstart.sh Script Does Not Unset Variables That Can Adversely Affect VM I-Net [1037776]</h3>

<p class="sub">The tomcat.sh script did not calculate JAVACMD if the environment variable already existed.  If a user already had this variable, VM I-Net would not use Merant's JVM.  This has been fixed.
</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Remove Command in pvcsstart.sh Script is Lacking "Force" Option [1037797]</h3>

<p class="sub">The remove command in the pvcsstart.sh script that clears Tomcat's work directory would require a response if any file in that directory is read-only.  This has been fixed.

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Specifying Journal File Using Filename Only Does Not Work Correctly [1036363]</h3>

<p>If you specified a journal file name while running a Journal Report from the VM GUI, VM would just look in the application binary directory for the journal files, not in each archive directory as it should have.

<p class="sub">The Visual SourceSafe to PVCS Converter fails if the path or project name contains parentheses.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Pre-existing PRECLASSPATH Resulted in Errors [1025407]</h3>

<p class="sub">Users who are using the available (Knowledgebase) documentation to make local copies of their JAR files are often running into major problems after installing a new release of Version Manager.  Because the PRECLASSPATH entry has not been removed, Version Manager may end up using (some of) the wrong class files, which can result in a wide range of unpredictable errors.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">GUI Menu Items Grayed Out [1023356]</h3>

<p class="sub">If there is a lot of network latency reading the access control database, GUI menu items (Get, Check In, etc.) are disabled--grayed out--once the PDB has loaded.  This has
been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Visual SourceSafe to PVCS Converter Fails to Convert Revisions Checked in After
a Rollback [102886]</h3>

<p class="sub">The Visual SourceSafe to PVCS converter fails to convert any revisions of a file that were checked in after a rollback operation was performed on the file.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI:  If a Command Fails the Status Variable Should Be Set to Reflect the Most
Severe Warning or Error that Occurred [1025192]</h3>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.  The value will be set to the most severe error encountered during an operation.  If the operation is recursive and both warnings and errors are generated, the value will be set to that of the first error encountered.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">GUI does not show promotion group association when you select from multiple locks [1027571]</h3>

<p class="sub">If a developer with multiple locks on a single revision checks in that revision, the GUI will ask what target revision to check in.  However, unlike CLI/PCLI, the GUI does not show which promotion groups these target revisions are associated with.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Double-clicking a Workfile Name that Contains Spaces Fails to Add File
[1030463]</h3>

<p class="sub">If you double-click to select a single workfile that has spaces in the name, VM appears to perform the action but the file is not added.  Instead, sub projects are created for each word in the file name.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI:  Documentation of -id Option is Confusing [1032398]</h3>

<p class="sub">The description of the -id option in the "PCLI User's Guide and Reference" is  confusing.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Filtered View Does Not Refresh [1032809]</h3>

<p class="sub">If you filter on version labels, locks, or promotion groups and you update a file so that it should no longer be included, it is still included even after doing a refresh.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">UNIX:  Execute Bits Are Removed From Workfiles Upon Check In [1032862]</h3>

<p class="sub">Using the default "Keep read-only workfile" setting, the execute bits are removed from workfiles upon check-in.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Value of &#36;HOME Not Expanded Correctly When You Override Check-Out Location [1033061]</h3>

<p class="sub">If you manually enter &#36;HOME as part of the path name when checking out a file, &#36;HOME does not get expanded.  Instead, Version Manager creates a directory named "&#36;HOME" in the directory from which Version Manager was launched.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Windows:  Operations on Large Project Databases Fail [4000796]</h3>

<p class="sub">The GUI and PCLI launcher on Win32 have a fixed maximum Java heap size of 96MB.  When you work on large project databases, this can cause even simple PCLI or GUI operations to fail.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Journal File Option "Include files of subprojects" Is Ignored [1033431]</h3>

<p class="sub">The Journal File option "Include files of subprojects" is ignored when the Version Manager option "Include subprojects in project operations" is selected.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Selecting Incorrect Workfile for Check In Produces Unhelpful Warning [1016929]</h3>

<p class="sub">If you browse to an alternate work file location and select the wrong workfile to check in, you will be warned that you are checking in from the wrong location.  However, it is easy to overlook the fact that the workfile name is different than the file you have checked out.  The warning should be different when there is a file name mismatch.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI:  AddFiles Command Cannot Add Workfiles from a Non-Default Location.  [4000787]</h3>

<p class="sub">PCLI AddFiles command cannot add a workfile from a non-default location without using the -c option.  By design, without using -c, the file should be added from the actual workfile location.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Workfiles Appearing in the BIN Directory [1034268]</h3>

<p class="sub">When you use the GUI to remove the reference directory it is set to REFERENCEDIR = "" in the CFG file.  The correct directive is REFERENCEDIR =.  When the configuration file of a project or project database contains the directive REFERENCEDIR = "" the current directory (from where GUI/Server was launched) will be used as the reference directory.  By default, this is the product's "bin" directory.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI:  vlog -l -z Lists all Versioned Files Rather than Just Locked Ones [1020274]</h3>

<p class="sub">The PCLI vlog -l -z command lists all versioned files rather than just the locked ones.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI:  ListRevision -f Hangs if Branch Contains Two-Digit Revision Number [1025739]</h3>

<p class="sub">When you run PCLI <span class="syntax">ListRevision</span> with the <span class="syntax">-f</span> option (resolve floating label) against a floating label that is associated with a branch containing a two-digit revision number (e.g., 1.10.1.*), PCLI hangs.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI:  Running External Commands Results in Out of Memory Errors [1006672]</h3>

<p class="sub">Running external commands from PCLI uses up memory resources, resulting in out of memory errors.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Visual SourceSafe to PVCS Convert Fails if Path or Project Name Contains Dollar Signs [1033574]</h3>

<p class="sub">The Visual SourceSafe to PVCS Converter fails if the path or project name contains dollar signs.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Cannot Add Workfiles to Projects that Contain Plus (+) Sign [1010523]</h3>

<p class="sub">If a project name contained a plus sign (+), then adding workfiles to that project would fail.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Delete Revision Functionality Missing from VM I-Net [1019772]</h3>

<p class="sub">VM I-Net did not support deleting revisions in previous releases.  This feature is now supported.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Browser Freezes When You Check Out Multiple (300+) Files [1022746]</h3>

<p class="sub">When you check out over 300 files on UNIX, Netscape freezes and needs to be restarted.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Users Cannot Add, Modify, or Delete Servlets while VM I-Net is Running [1022012]</h3>

<p class="sub">Users needed to shut down VM I-Net in order to add, modify, and delete servlets.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Problems with a Chinese Character [4000418]</h3>

<p class="sub">VM I-Net corrupts the character with the unicode value of \u9FS2.  This character is essential when the word "function" is used in Chinese.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Resource Locked by Session Error [1022744]</h3>

<p class="sub">Long operations could cause other users logging in to receive a "resource locked by" error message.  This has been fixed with the addition of daemon processes.  Refer to PVCS Version Manager Installation Guide for instructions on enabling daemons.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Installation May Fail to Create Jakarta ISAPI Filter [1032634]</h3>

<p class="sub">The installation program may not create the ISAPI filter on Windows.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Check Out Location Grayed Out on Non-English Clients [1033798]</h3>

<p class="sub">When you use a workstation with French or German regional settings and hit a UNIX VM I-Net server (with English settings), the check-out location is a gray box that cannot be viewed or modified.  If the work station settings are set to English UK or English US, then the checkout works.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Certain Characters in Workspace Names Cause Errors [1034222]</h3>

<p class="sub">A workspace name of "C:\" causes errors in VM I-Net.  Such names are not a problem for the GUI.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">When VcsEdit Directive is Enabled Check In Still Prompts for Changes [226266]</h3>

<p class="sub">Check-in prompts for a change description twice when the VcsEdit directive is defined.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Some Filenames are Not Visible in the Change Description Dialog Box [1001746]</h3>

<p class="sub">Workfile names with long paths are not always visible in the change description dialog box.  This has been fixed:  A new field has been added to the dialog box so the entire workfile path can be viewed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Branches are Not Labeled Correctly in Revision Pane [1003022]</h3>

<p class="sub">The &quot;trunk&quot; or main branch of development was historically labeled &quot;1.*&quot;.  However, this does not accurately describe the &quot;trunk&quot; branch of development in all environments.  This has been changed to reflect the major number of the tip revision in the versioned file.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI ForEach Statement with Empty Arguments Causes a Stack Trace [1007132]</h3>

<p class="sub">A PCLI ForEach statement in a PCLI script that included variables resolving in empty arguments is not correctly handling certain statements.  In some cases a stack trace is generated.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Unexpected Results During an Add Files Operation [1009699]</h3>

<p class="sub">In the Add Workfiles dialog box, when you add a single file to source control and modify the file name with a space, unpredictable results occur.  In some cases this creates projects even when the current user does not have appropriate permissions to do so.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Version Labels Containing Commas Cause Incorrect Results When You Apply Filters [1014901]</h3>

<p class="sub">When you apply a file filter based on version labels and filter on version labels that contain commas, the filter produces incorrect results.

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Revision Properties Shows Incorrect Revision Number [1015045]</h3>

<p class="sub">Viewing properties of a revision sometimes shows the properties of another revision.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI <span class="syntax">vlog -br</span> Ignores Revision Argument [1015099]</h3>

<p class="sub">The PCLI <span class="syntax">vlog -br</span> command ignores the revision specification and produces a report of all revisions.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Defining Default Version in Private Workspaces Requires Configure Project Permissions [1015825]</h3>

<p class="sub">Defining Default Version, Branch Version, Base Version, and Default Development Level promotion group in a private workspace no longer requires the ConfigureProject privilege.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Revision Properties Does Not Correctly Show Branch Revisions [1015925]</h3>

<p class="sub">Viewing properties of a branch revision always defaults to showing the properties of the versioned file.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI <span class="syntax">vlog -l</span> Lists Revisions That are Not Locked [1020274]</h3>

<p class="sub">The PCLI <span class="syntax">vlog -l</span> command ignores the locker specification and lists all revisions.  This has been fixed:  The command has been corrected to honor the <span class="syntax">-l</span> parameter and only list locked revisions.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Command Macro Does Not Differentiate Among Products [1020619]</h3>

<p class="sub">The <span class="syntax">&#36;(Command)</span> macro is always set to "VMGUI" when you run the VM GUI, VM PCLI, or VM I-Net components.</p>

<p class="sub">This has been fixed.  Version Manager now correctly distinguishes among these components by setting the <span class="syntax">&#36;(Command)</span> macro to the following values:</p>

<table class="sub" style="margin-bottom: 14.0pt;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="2" summary="Two-column table">

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Project Tree Partially Collapses After Importing Archives [1026856]</h3>

<p class="sub">After you perform an Import Archive operation, the Project Tree partially collapses requiring you to browse back to your original project.  This has been fixed.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PCLI <span class="syntax">CreateProject</span> Does Not Allow for a Fully Qualified Path Argument [1026937]</h3>

<p class="sub">The PCLI <span class="syntax">CreateProject</span> command does not specify a project with a fully qualified entity path.  This requires users to use the <span class="syntax">-pp</span> parameter when creating subprojects.  This has been fixed:  The <span class="syntax">CreateProject</span> command now allows you to specify projects with relative or absolute entity paths.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">PreClassPath Statement is Limited to 256 Characters [1027088]</h3>

<p class="sub">The PRECLASSPATH setting in the islv.ini file is limited to 256 characters; in many situations this path exceeds the limit.  This has been fixed:  The limit was increased to allow up to 20 paths of MAXPATH length.</p>

This has been fixed:  The command was changed to remove configuration files when the <span class="syntax">-c</span> flag is omitted.  See PCLI <span class="syntax">SetConfigFileCmd -h</span> for more details.</p>

<h3 class="keepWithNext">Absolute Entity Paths are Misinterpreted as Relative Paths When Enclosed in Double Quotation-Marks [1030560]</h3>

<p class="sub">PCLI entity paths enclosed in quotation marks are misinterpreted as relative entity paths causing confusion and in some cases undesirable results.  This has been fixed.</p>
