<p>For information on what is in the Beta of Version Manager 8 and what will be in the final release, see the What's New topic. Once the Beta program is complete, this page will describe the development of Version Manager beyond version 8.</p>


<!--


<p>This is a dynamic year at Merant, with strong investment in R&amp;D, 
 Support and adding value to the customer experience. Because you will 
 want to plan ahead to make the most of your PVCS investment, Merant is 
 pleased to share our product direction with you. For details, please contact 
 your Merant Sales Representative.</p>

<h1>Security</h1>

<p>In 2003, on top of the existing security within Version Manager (Access 
 Control Database and respect for file system permissions), VM will be 
 enhanced so write access to the archives will not be required. Subsequently, 
 VM will be enhanced to restrict read access to the archives. </p>

<p>Our <b>LDAP</b> support in VM will be enhanced with single-sign-on authentication.</p>

<h1>Distributed Development</h1>

<p>In 2003, expect increasing parity between the desktop and browser clients 
 with each new release. Also in 2003, support for a new build technology 
 that includes <b>ANT</b> integration and enables remote build management, 
 as well as support for a new deploy product module to enable automatic 
 deployment of software assets to production systems.</p>

<p>Tighter integration directly with <b>Microsoft Office</b> (beyond current 
 WebDAV access) is coming. This will enable Version Manager control of 
 Office documents and items, so that all critical project assets, both 
 software and documentation assets, can be protected in a single location.</p>

<h1>Scalability</h1>

<p>In 2003, you can expect to see up to 2 – 3x <b>performance</b> improvements 
 for labeling, promoting, check in/out and get/put operations across the 
 LAN or WAN. Beyond that, a client/server database driven architecture 
 will be applied to add even more scalability, flexibility and capability. 
 You will be able to install releases based on the new architecture and 
 use them with existing implementations.</p>

<p>Concurrent licensing and tracking with <b>FLEXlm</b> will be available 
 in 2003. This will improve your management of user compliance, identify 
 peak usage periods and most active users, and thus enable more flexible 
 usage scenarios.</p>

<h1>Flexibility</h1>

<p>In early 2003, support for Mercury TestDirector 7.6 will be added. </p>

<h2>For More Information</h2>

<p>This and more information can be found in the new pull-down menus (<i>What's 
 New</i> and <i>What's Coming</i>), on SupportNet <a href="http://support.merant.com/main.asp">http://support.merant.com/main.asp</a> 
 and within the product online help.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 14pt;">What Else is Coming in PVCS Professional?</h1>

<h1>Tracker</h1>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>In 2003, support will be added for <b>LDAP</b> compliant authentication 
 systems (such as Novell, Active Directory and iPlanet) to streamline user 
 facilitation and enable single-sign-on support.</p>

<h2>Distributed Development</h2>

<p>In 2003, expect increasing parity between the desktop and browser clients 
 with each new release. </p>

<h2>Scalability</h2>

<p>In 2003, multi-threading of the Tracker browser client will allow parallel 
 requests to take place as well improved key word seearch capabilities. 
 Concurrent licensing and tracking with <b>FLEXlm</b> will be available 
 in 2003. This will improve your management of user compliance, identify 
 peak usage periods and most active users, and thus enable more flexible 
 usage scenarios.</p>

<h2>Flexibility</h2>

<p>In 2003, look for process-driven capabilities based on <b>parent-child 
 relationships</b>. Parent-child relationships will enable both spawning 
 of new work tasks for subactivities, and the ability to relate these subactivities 
 so that they must be completed before the parent item can be retired. 
 Also coming will be the ability to manage <b>multiple issue types</b> 
 (enhance, defect, task, requirement) from within a single project.</p>
