<h1 class="whs1">What's New in Serena&#174; ChangeMan&#174; Version Manager&trade;?</h1>

<p>Building upon the core Version Manager 8 release of enhancements and new features, this latest release provides a rich IDE integration for Microsoft Visual Studio .Net and for Eclipse-based IDEs such as IBM WSAD/RAD.  By integrating the core capabilities of Version Manager into the IDE using the IDE's native controls and mechanisms, the developer experience has been significantly improved.</p>

<p>In addition, this release of Version Manager supports a tight integration with Serena TeamTrack, providing the ability to manage and associate TeamTrack issues and defects with the versioned artifacts that are changed to address them.</p>

<p>The core Version Manager 8 release adds enhancements and new features in three areas identified by users as key to today's team development:  performance and scalability, security, and support for distributed development.</p>


<h1>Performance and Scalability</h1>

<p>Version Manager 8 introduces the Version Manager File Server service, which avoids the performance issues of using mapped drives or an NFS mount.  With File Server, teams can reduce network traffic and significantly improve performance for many common source-control operations.</p>

<p>The File Server uses a high-performance file streaming technique to move data across the network, allowing Version Manager clients to operate faster than when using the block transfer method employed by traditional network file system interfaces.</p>


<h1>Security</h1>

<p>With version 8, Version Manager now makes the configuration process of supporting multiple redundant LDAP servers or referrals much simpler, with easy setup and configuration directly supported through the Project Configuration dialog box.</p>

<p>Version 8 uses the security of the Version Manager File Server to avoid accidental or unauthorized modification or deletion of assets.  The File Server makes it possible to physically isolate the project data from the end user by taking away the need to have end-user file-level access to the archives and metadata.</p>


<h1>Distributed Development</h1>

<p>With this release, parity between the web and desktop clients is significantly improved.  The web client now includes the following advanced features previously available only with the desktop client:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Serena ChangeMan Merge tool for differencing and merging of files and revisions</li>

  <li>Sorting by a particular column of data in the Content pane, such as Locked By or Date Checked In</li>

  <li>Listing files recursively in the Content pane</li>

  <li>Browse dialog for selecting revisions, version labels, and promotion groups to simplify completion of dialog boxes</li>

</ul>


<h1 class="whs2">What Else Is New in Serena ChangeMan Professional Suite?</h1>

<h1>TeamTrack</h1>

<p>For information on the capabilities and features that TeamTrack brings to Version Manager users, see the <a href="about_teamtrack.html">About TeamTrack</a> topic in the Version Manager help.</p>
