<H1><A NAME="abouthistoryreport"></A>About History Reports</H1>
<p>A history report summarizes information about archives and/or revisions. You can generate a history report for a project database, project, multiple versioned files, a single versioned file, or a specific revision. You can use a history report to monitor the development process, review archive histories, and check archive attributes. Note that the history report was called archive report in previous releases of Version Manager.</p>

<p>History reports can include archive information (when and by whom an archive was created, archive attributes, who has revisions locked, and archive and workfile names) and revision information (revision descriptions and history). </p>

<h2>Types of History Reports</h2>
<p>You can select the following types of history reports:
<ul>
	<li><b>Full:</b> provides comprehensive information about when and by whom the archive was created, when and by whom each revision was added, what attributes are set on the archive, and general information about the file's change descriptions, version labels, promotion group assignments, and locks.
	<li><b>File information only:</b> provides general information about the file, itself, including the location of its archive, the name of its workfile, how many revisions it has, what attributes have been set on its archive, who created the archive, what locks are placed on it, what version labels have been assigned to it, and what change descriptions have been added to it.
	<li><b>Revision information only:</b> identifies the name and location of its archive and when and by whom the revisions were added to the archive. 
	<li><b>List locked revisions:</b> lists the revisions within a file that are locked.
	<li><b>List revisions with version label:</b> lists the revisions assigned version labels and the assigned version labels.
	<li><b>List revisions in group:</b> lists the revisions assigned to a specific promotion group.
	<li><b>List newest revisions:</b> if multiple versioned files are selected, lists the revisions most recently checked in to Version Manager.
	<li><b>Check tips against version/revision:</b> provides information about archives whose tip revisions 
  are different the specified revision or version.</li>              
</ul>
<P>You can further restrict any of the report types you choose by any two of the 
following:</P>
<ul>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Authors of revisions</li>
<li>Users who have revisions locked</li>
<li>Owners of the archive</li>
<p>Your privileges dictate if you can generate a history report and the information that is available for the report.</p>
