<P>
<P>SourceBridge integrates Serena's version control and issue management solutions. This allows you to associate issues created in <a HREF="about_teamtrack.html">TeamTrack</a> and Tracker with versioned files when you check files in and out from source control. SourceBridge setup varies depending on which Version Manager clients and issue tracking system you use (see the following table).</p>

<p><b>NOTE</b> A specific TeamTrack user privilege is required in order to run TeamTrack SourceBridge. See your TeamTrack administrator if necessary.</p>

From the About dialog, select the Product Information tab. Click on the Install SourceBridge link. For complete instructions, see the <i>SourceBridge User's Guide</i>.<br><br>Once the SourceBridge component is installed, SourceBridge will be set as your Source Code Control (SCC) provider.

You can change SCC providers via the Serena SCC Admin utility (from the Serena folder of the Windows Start menu, select ChangeMan Version Manager | Version Manager IDE Client | Version Manager SCC Admin). See the <i>Serena ChangeMan IDE Client Implementation Guide</i> for more information. </TD>
