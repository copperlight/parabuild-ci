<hr align=left color=#303090 size=3>

<h1><script>document.write(getH1());</script>Known Issues (All Platforms)</h1>

<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>Only Perl 5.6, 5.6.1 Supported</h2>

<p>Serena ChangeMan Builder has been tested with Perl 5.6 and 5.6.1, but not
with Perl 5.8. ChangeMan Builder is not guaranteed to work with Perl 5.8.</p>

<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>&quot;My Computer&quot; Incorrectly Listed in Integrated Web Client</h2>

<p>On all platforms, the integrated web client displays a list of build machines
that includes &quot;My Computer&quot;.  This is incorrect.  Local builds are not available from 
the integrated web client.  You should not select &quot;My Computer&quot; as a build machine from the
integrated web client.</p>


<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>Install Fails if JAVA_HOME Not Set Properly</h2>

<p>On all platforms, you must install Java and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable
before attempting to install ChangeMan Builder.</p>

<p>If you have multiple Java installations on your machine, you can run the installer from
the command line and specify a particular Java directory to use:</p>

    <p>install.exe  LAX_VM &lt;<em>java_path</em>&gt;\java.exe</p>



<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>In Standalone Web Client: Changes to Custom Options Are Not Saved</h2>

<p>If you make a change to a custom option, the change may not get saved unless you also make a change to a dependency.
As a workaround, you can define a new dependency, then delete it, and then save the build job. The changes to 
custom options will then be saved.</p>

<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>In Standalone Web Client: Use Mouse to Move Between Fields</h2>

<p>When defining custom options, use the mouse to move between fields. The TAB key is not enabled 
for this page. This will be fixed in a subsequent release.</p>


<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>In Standalone Web Client: Click on Build Task to Enable Delete Button for Custom Options</h2>

<p>If you wish to delete a custom option and the Delete button is not enabled, click on the name of the associated build task first.  
This will enable the button.</p>


<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>In Standalone Web Client: Cut-and-Paste Not Available From Menus</h2>

<p>In the standalone web client, cut-and-paste is not available from the menus, but is available using Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V.</P>

<h2><script type="text/javascript">document.write(getH2());</script>In Standalone Web Client on WinXP:  Cut, Copy, and Paste Require JRE 1.4.1_02</h2>

<p>If you are running on Windows XP, you must have version 1.4.1_02 or later of Sun's JRE, or the 
Clipboard functions will not work in the standalone web client.</p>




<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>For Configuration Builder: Merant CB Build Type Missing</h2>

<p>The Merant CB build type needed to use ChangeMan Builder with Merant Configuration Builder was inadvertently
left out of the release.  The build type has been included in the Patches directory on the install CD.
See the Readme that accompanies the patch for installation instructions.</P>


<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>In VM Integration: Set JAVA_HOME at Start of Build Job</h2>
<p>If you are running a build job from within the Version Manager integration, you should add 
instructions to the beginning of each Java build job to set the value of JAVA_HOME.  (On UNIX, 
you must also export the value of the variable.)</p>
<p>You should do this because Version Manager installs its own Java runtime environment (JRE 1.4.1_05), 
and sets JAVA_HOME to point there.  If your work depends on a particular JRE version, you can guarantee the 
usage of that version by setting this variable.</p>
<p>To set the value of JAVA_HOME in a build job, edit the Build Commands field on the Submission dialog box.
For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
   <p><b>Windows</b>: set JAVA_HOME=&lt;<em>location of JRE</em>&gt;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p><b>UNIX</b>: set JAVA_HOME=&lt;<em>location of JRE</em>&gt;;export JAVA_HOME</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to set JAVA_HOME before the build commands that refer to bldmake and om.</p>


<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>In VM Integration: Delay When Selecting ChangeMan Builder Action</h2>
<p>When you select Build from the Actions menu (or from the context menu or toolbar), there is a delay while ChangeMan Builder loads the initial dialog box.</P>


<h2><script type="text/javascript">document.write(getH2());</script>Using Remote Build Server with VM Integration Requires Version Manager</h2>

<p>If you are using the version of Serena ChangeMan Builder that is integrated with Version Manager, any
remote build server that you define must also use the Version Manager integration. This means that 
the remote build server machine must have Version Manager installed on it.</p>

<p>On the remote build server machine, run the regular local install for
Version Manager, and select only Desktop Client for the installation. 
This will install PCLI and the Version Manager integration.</p>

<p>Note also that the Version Manager instance installed on the remote build server 
must have a named license. This license will be included when you purchase the 
Serena ChangeMan Builder remote build server license. This Version Manager named license 
must be assigned to the user ID that is used for the Serena ChangeMan Builder remote build server.</p>


<h2><script type="text/javascript">document.write(getH2());</script>Patch Required for Installing Remote Build Server on Same Machine as Knowledge Base Server</h2>

<p><b>NOTE</b> Serena does not recommend this procedure, as it can cause the Knowledge Base server (KB server) to run less efficiently than it would otherwise.
  However, the procedure will work and is preferred by some customers who have only one build machine.</p>

<p>On all platforms, if you wish to install a remote build server on the same machine 
that contains the Knowledge Base server, you must install the InstallRBSonKBS patch. </p>

<p>See the instructions included with the patch, on the install CD:</p>

<p>
<span class="syntax">
<em>&lt;CD&gt;</em>\cmnbuilder\patches\InstallRBSonKBS
 <br>
</span>
</p>


<h2><script type="text/javascript">document.write(getH2());</script>In Integrated Web Client: Commands Added to Build Commands Field May Be Truncated</h2>
<p>In the integrated web client, ChangeMan Builder may incorrectly parse 
the contents of the Build Commands field, if you have added commands to it. 
Specifically, if you add a string containing "om" (lower-case only), 
Builder may incorrectly interpret this as part of the om command. 
You may see truncated commands as a result, and the build job may fail to execute.</p>

<p>If the offending string is part of a directory path, you can try using 
a different directory path as a workaround.</p>





<h1><script>document.write(getH1());</script>Known Windows Issues</h1>

<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>Install Patch for Remote Build Servers</h2>

<p>On Windows remote build servers only, you must install the RBS_Licensing patch in order to
resolve a problem with consuming remote build server licenses. This patch should
be applied only to a remote build server.</p>

<p>See the instructions included with the patch, on the install CD:</p>

<p>
<span class="syntax">
<em>&lt;CD&gt;</em>\cmnbuilder\patches\RBS_Licensing
 <br>
</span>
</p>


<h2><script type="text/javascript">document.write(getH2());</script>Build Log Fails to Display</h2>
<p>Normally, after a build job is executed, a build log appears in a browser window.
If the user who requests the build has logged in originally with a mixed-case user ID,
the build log may not display.</p>
<p>To solve this problem:</p>
<ol>
  <li>On the KnowledgeBase server machine, navigate to the following directory:
  <p>&lt;<em>install directory</em>&gt;\ChangeMan\Builder\tomcat\webapps\openmake.ear\openmake.war\logs</p>
  </li>
  <li>Rename any subdirectory found here that is in mixed-case.</li>
</ol>

<h2><script type="text/javascript">document.write(getH2());</script>Use Sun's JRE, Not jview.exe</h2>

<p>During the installation of the Serena ChangeMan Builder Knowledge Base server, you are asked to select a Java
runtime executable. In the dialog provided for selecting this item, you may see jview.exe selected by default, 
but you should NOT select jview.exe.  If you do, the install of a needed Serena ChangeMan Builder service (the "Openmake" service)
may fail. Instead, use the Search button on the dialog to locate the Sun JRE executable. You should have 
previously installed version 1.4.1_02 or later of the Sun JRE.</p>


<h2><script type="text/javascript">document.write(getH2());</script>In Standalone Web Client: Footprinting Header Wrong</h2>
<p>In the standalone web client, the footprinting feature displays a header referring to Dimensions.  
This is incorrect and will be fixed in the next release.</p>

<p align=right><a href="#TOP"><i><font size=-2>To
TOC</font></i></a></p>

<hr align=left color=#303090 size=3>


<h1><script>document.write(getH1());</script>Known UNIX Issues</h1>

<a name="SuSE9.0 Install"></a>
<h2><script type="text/javascript">document.write(getH2());</script> SuSE: Installation Procedure for SuSE 9.0</h2>

<p>The ChangeMan Builder installer does not specifically call out SuSE 9.0, but 
you can still install the ChangeMan Builder client on that platform.</p>

<p>To install ChangeMan Builder on SuSE 9.0:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Before attempting to install Builder on SuSE 9.0, be sure that the compat libraries are installed.
  <br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>During the Builder client install, after you enter the hostname and port, the installer shows you a panel with three check boxes:
      <ul>
         <li>  Program Files</li>
         <li>  RedHat 7.1, Enterprise 2.1 or SuSe 7.3, 8.0 Executables</li>
         <li>  Example Files</li>
      </ul>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li>Select <b>Program Files</b> and <b>Example Files</b>.
  <br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>Do not select the check box that mentions SuSE 7.3 and 8.0.<br></li>
  <br>
  <li>Proceed with the rest of the installation.<br></li>
</ol>


<h2><script type="text/javascript">document.write(getH2());</script> AIX: Knowledge Base Server or Remote Build Server Cannot Connect to License Server</h2>
<p>On AIX, a KnowledgeBase Server or Remote Build Server may fail to connect to the License Server.
When this happens, you will see an "unknown host" error.</p>
<p>The solution is to add a value for the NSORDER variable in the startup and shutdown scripts for the servers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Knowledge Base server will have to be restarted, so have users log off.</li><br><br>
  <li>Locate the startup and shutdown scripts for the Knowledge Base server 
and for any remote build servers:
<span class="syntax"><br>
  <br><em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em>/serena/changeman/builder/Start_Knowledge_Base_Server
  <br><em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em>/serena/changeman/builder/Stop_Knowledge_Base_Server
  <br><em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em>/serena/changeman/builder/Start_Build_Server
  <br><em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em>/serena/changeman/builder/Stop_Build_Server
<br>
<br>
</span>
</li>

<li>In each case, add the following statements to the startup/shutdown 
script:
<span class="syntax"><br>
<br>NSORDER=local,nis,bind,local
<br>export NSORDER</span>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>Restart the Knowledge Base server and any remote build servers.</li>
</ol>



<h2><script type="text/javascript">document.write(getH2());</script> Solaris: Procedure in Version Manager Readme No Longer Necessary</h2>
<p>Because Serena ChangeMan Builder offers an integration with Version Manager, the Version Manager
Readme describes a procedure addressing an issue with the Serena ChangeMan Builder integration on Solaris.  
This procedure appears in the Version Manager Readme under the title "Serena ChangeMan Builder Integration on Solaris".</p>
<p>However, this procedure is now unnecessary, because of a patch included on this CD (and described 
in a subsequent section).</p>
<p>If you have already performed the steps described in the Version Manager Readme procedure, 
Serena ChangeMan Builder will still work.  However, if you wish to use Version Manager in non-setuid mode, 
you should perform the following steps to reverse the procedure described 
in the Version Manager Readme.</p>

<ol><LI>Open the following file in a text editor:<br><br>
<em>&ltinstall_location&gt</em>/vm/solaris/bin/vmprofile <BR><BR></LI>
<LI>Remove the <span class="syntax">#</span> character at the beginning of the following line (line 41):<br><br>
<span class="syntax">#Add2LibPath "/apps/pvcs/vm/common/lib/solaris" PRE</span><BR><BR></LI>
<LI>Save the file.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI>Open the following file in a text editor:<br><br>
<em>&ltinstall_location&gt</em>/vm/solaris/bin/pvcsvmdmn<BR><BR></LI>
<LI>Find the following line (line 257):<br><br>
<span class="syntax">LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/lwp:${threadslib}:${jrelibs}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/lib:/usr/ucblib:/usr/lib/secure </span><br><br></LI>
<LI>Just after <span class="syntax">lwp:</span>, add this text to the line:<br><br>
<span class="syntax">${classroot}/${osDir}:</span><BR><BR>
So the modified line looks like:<br><br>
<span class="syntax">LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/lwp:${classroot}/${osDir}:${threadslib}:${jrelibs}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/lib:/usr/ucblib:/usr/lib/secure</span><BR><BR></LI>
<LI>Save the file.<BR><BR></LI>
</ol>

<p>On Solaris, build jobs may fail with a link error. The GNU_Footprinting patch addresses this problem.

<p>See the instructions included with the patch, on the install CD:</p>

<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>UNIX and Linux: Change $home to $HOME</h2>

<p>On UNIX and Linux, the default Bulid Directory value in the Version Manager
integration is $home/Builder. The $home environment variable needs to be $HOME.</p>

<p>You can change the $home environment variable in the Build Parameters dialog.<p>

<h1><script>document.write(getH1());</script>Known PCLI Issues</h1>

<h2>
<script>document.write(getH2());</script>
Spaces in Build Directory Path Can Cause PCLI Error</h2>
<p>On UNIX platforms, a build directory path that contains a space
can cause a PCLI error.</p>

<p>This can occur in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When PCLI is run from the shell, and the directory in which the PCLI command 
      is invoked contains a space.
  </li>
  <li>When the build directory set in the VM integration or standalone web client
      contains a space.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>  In the first case, you will see a message 
indicating that the directory does not exist, or that the
specified substitution is not valid for the command.
For example:

<span class="syntax"><br>
<br>/usr/serena/vm/solaris/bin/pvcsvmdmn: /home/pvcs/my: does not exist
<br></span>
</p>

<p>In the second case, you will see a message indicating
that the bldmake VM integration completed with errors, 
and then a message indicating that the PCLI command banner could
not be found.</p>

<p>To fix either instance of this problem, modify the pvcsvmdmn script identified 
in the error message by changing the line:</p>

<p>
<span class="syntax">
cd ${EXEDIR}
<br><br></span>

to

<span class="syntax">
<br><br>cd "${EXEDIR}"
<br></span>
</p>

<p>This will resolve the problem.</p>

<h1><script>document.write(getH1());</script>Documentation Issues</h1>

<h2>
<script>document.write(getH2());</script>
Adobe Acrobat Full-Text Search Gives Duplicate Results</h2>
<p>Adobe Acrobat may remember the last index that was used
for a full-text search.  This can cause Acrobat to search the index of the
current document and of a previous document, resulting in duplication of search
results.  To avoid this, make sure that only the index for the current document
is selected (see the install guide for details on selecting a search index).</p>

Help Does Not Work on Internet Explorer Using Sun's 1.4.0x JRE</h2>
<p>The Version Manager help, which includes ChangeMan Builder help topics, will not launch on Internet
Explorer if IE is using Sun's 1.4.0x JRE.  Use 1.3x or 1.4.1x instead.</p>

Help TOC Does Not Resize in Netscape</h2>
<p>If you resize the Netscape browser window, the TOC pane
of the help may not resize correctly.  To reload the TOC into the resized pane,
click the Hide Navigation link, then click the Show Navigation link.</p>

<h2><script>document.write(getH2());</script>Help Navigation Pane Invisible with Sun's JVM</h2>

<p>When viewing the online help on Windows&nbsp;XP using Microsoft IE 6.0 with Sun's JVM, the navigation pane in the online help comes up blank.  You can work around this by disabling Sun's VM and using the Microsoft VM to view the help.</p>
