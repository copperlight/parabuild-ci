<h1>Understanding Group Privileges and Access Rights</h1>

<p class=Body>When users log onto a server configuration, they are identified 
 individually by their user names and as members of the groups to which 
 they belong. The application stores this information as an access token 
 for each user. As users perform operations on application objects (projects, 
 views, folders, and items), the application examines these tokens and 
 the access rights for the objects on which the users are performing the 
 operations.</p>

<p class=Body>The application checks access rights in layers. The right 
 to access an object begins with the <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>System 
 Policy</I></span> dialog, which can be accessed from the <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Server 
 Administration</I></span> dialog. When not ignored, the right of ownership 
 and the right of privileges take precedence over all other rights configured 
 elsewhere.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>By default, the application 
 gives special rights to the owner of an item or object (generally, the 
 user who created the project, view, folder, or item). Unless ownership 
 is being ignored, the right of ownership overrides and takes precedence 
 over all rights configured elsewhere.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Similarly, unless group 
 privileges are being ignored, these privileges also override and take 
 precedence over rights configured elsewhere. Privileges are group properties 
 set on the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Privileges</B></span> tab of the 
 <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Group Properties</I></span> dialog. </p></li>
	
	<p class=Bullet-1-text>A user is granted the same privileges as those 
 of the group to which he or she belongs. If the user belongs to two groups, 
 and one is granted certain privileges while the other is denied the same 
 privileges, the user is granted the privileges. </p>
</ul>

<p class=Body>After consideration of object ownership and/or group privileges, 
 the application checks the access rights granted for specific objects. 
 Settings on the <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Access</I></span> <span 
 style="font-style: italic;"><I>Rights</I></span> dialogs for projects, views, 
 folders, and individual items grant or deny users or groups the ability 
 to perform operations at those levels. It is important to remember that 
 if access rights are granted to any user or group at a given level in 
 an <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Access Rights</I></span> dialog, users 
 or groups who are not granted access rights at that level are effectively 
 denied all rights. </p>

<p class=Body>Ultimately, if a user can see an object and is not stopped 
 from performing an operation by a deny record, the user can do anything 
 that a grant record allows, whether as an individual user or as a member 
 of any group. The only exceptions have to do with ownership and privileges.</p>

<p class=Proc>To determine whether a user can perform an operation, the 
 application performs the following checks:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CList-1><p class=List-1>If the user requesting the 
 operation is the owner of the object being operated on and ownership is 
 not being ignored, access to the object is granted. When ownership is 
 not ignored, it takes precedence over both privileges and access rights.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CList-1><p class=List-1>If the user belongs to a 
 group that has an appropriate privilege and privileges are not being ignored, 
 access to the object is granted. Privileges, when not ignored, take precedence 
 over the access rights that are set. Users who belong to a group with 
 the correct privileges can have rights that are specifically denied to 
 them in the application.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CList-1><p class=List-1>If a user or group to which 
 a user belongs has satisfactory access rights set for an object on which 
 an operation will be performed, access is granted to the user. If the 
 object has access rights set, but none are satisfactory, the user is denied 
 access. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CList-1><p class=List-1>If no access rights have 
 been set for the object, step 3 is repeated at the next higher level.</p></li>
	
	<ul>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>If the operation 
 is on an item, the access rights for the parent folder are checked.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>If the operation 
 is on a root folder, the access rights for the view are checked.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>If the operation 
 is on a view, the access rights for the project are checked.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>If the operation 
 is creating a project, the Server access rights are checked.</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CList-1><p class=List-1>If none of the levels has 
 access rights set, access is granted to the user.</p></li>
</ol>
