<h1>Understanding VSS to StarTeam Interoperability</h1>

<p class=Body>The following changes to the VSS database are recognized 
 and/or reproduced in StarTeam.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Checking out a file (setting 
 a lock).</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Undoing a file checkout 
 (removing a lock).</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Adding revisions.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Adding and deleting files.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Adding subprojects (adding 
 a folder).</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Modifying the working 
 file following an add or check-in operation (when keyword expansion is 
 enabled).</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=Body>These changes in VSS are relayed to StarTeam.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Sharing files and folders 
 (VSS 6.0 or higher only). </p></li>
</ul>

<p class=Body>When the following functions are performed in VSS, they are 
 not currently recognized by or reproduced in StarTeam. Some of these operations 
 can cause StarTeam to generate errors when accessing VSS.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Deleting folders (however, 
 you can delete the folder from StarTeam in a separate operation).</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Recovering deleted folders 
 or files.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Renaming projects or 
 subfolders. StarTeam treats the renamed project or folder as a new folder, 
 which results in two copies of the folder in StarTeam, one with the old 
 name and one with the new name. As a workaround, you can delete the folder 
 with the old name from the folder hierarchy. Never rename folders in StarTeam 
 because VSS will continue to use the previous name.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Moving projects. StarTeam 
 classifies a moved project or folder as a new folder, which results in 
 two copies of that folder in StarTeam. Attempts to access the original 
 folder in StarTeam produces errors in VSS because the folder is no longer 
 in that location. As a workaround, you can delete the folder in the old 
 location from the folder hierarchy.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Adding labels to revisions.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Branching. StarTeam does 
 not read the action records in a file to re-create the branching hierarchy. 
 Therefore, it classifies branched files as totally separate files that 
 happen to have the same history up until the point at which they branched. 
 No historical information is lost, but the fact that these two files were 
 once the same file is not known to StarTeam.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Historical changes to 
 the folder hierarchy in VSS are not visible in rollback views in StarTeam.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>If you roll back a file 
 in VSS, StarTeam does not recognize new revisions of that file until the 
 number of VSS revisions for the file reaches its pre-rollback number.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Changes to working folder 
 paths in VSS are not recognized by StarTeam. In addition, working folder 
 paths are not stored per user. Currently, StarTeam forces working folder 
 paths to be relative to the root folder for the view.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Renamed files are recognized 
 by StarTeam as new files. Operations on the original files will result 
 in errors in StarTeam.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Rolling back revisions 
 is not currently implemented in StarTeam. If performed in VSS, you must 
 delete the files that have been rolled back from StarTeam, then press 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>F6</B></span> to re-synchronize with VSS. 
 The deleted files will reappear, but with fewer revisions in their history. 
 If you roll back the StarTeam view, you will see two files with the same 
 name, but they may have different labels.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Revisions that were pinned 
 after the wrapping process took place are not recognized by StarTeam. 
 A pinned revision has been specified as the only revision of a file that 
 can be checked out. If revision 10 of 12 revisions is the pinned revision, 
 StarTeam considers this file to have the status Out-of-date, even though 
 you cannot check out any revision other than 10.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>File descriptions that 
 are updated in VSS are not updated in StarTeam. After a wrap, the description 
 for each file is Initial revision. If you modify the description in VSS, 
 and do a refresh in StarTeam, this description does not change. </p></li>
</ul>

<p class=Body>None of the database options available in VSS are used in 
 StarTeam. For example, the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Delete working 
 file</B></span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>on check-in</B></span> option 
 in VSS has no effect on StarTeam clients that access the VSS database. 
 However, each StarTeam user can set some equivalent Personal Options in 
 the application. </p>
