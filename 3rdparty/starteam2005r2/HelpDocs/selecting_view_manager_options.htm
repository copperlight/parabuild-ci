<h1>Selecting View Manager Options</h1>

<p class=Body>Before running View Manager, you should select appropriate 
 options for the merge you plan to perform. Although View Manager has many 
 run options, many of them do not apply to all types of run operations. 
 However, all run operations share some options. For example, the <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;"><B>General</B></span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Locking</B></span> 
 tabs apply to all operations.</p>

<p class=Proc>To select View Manager options:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CList-1><p class=List-1>Start View Manager.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CList-1><p class=List-1>Select<span style="font-weight: bold;"><B> 
 Tools &gt; Options</B></span>. The <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Options</I></span> 
 dialog displays. At the top of the dialog, a drop-down list box appears, 
 from which you can select:</p></li>
	
	<ul>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1
										style="font-weight: bold;">Source 
 to Target </p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1
										style="font-weight: bold;">Bidirectional 
 </p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1
										style="font-weight: bold;">Missing 
 Objects Only </p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1
										style="font-weight: bold;">Copy 
 to Target</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p class=List-1-text>Each of these items represents a specific type 
 of run operation. When you select an item from this list, the tabs and 
 options available for that type of run operation are enabled on the <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Options</B></span> tabs. </p>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CList-1><p class=List-1>Select a specific type of 
 run operation.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CList-1><p class=List-1>On the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>General</B></span> 
 tab, select the options you wish to use with this type of operation.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CList-1><p class=List-1>Move to the remaining tabs, 
 and specify additional options.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CList-1><p class=List-1>When you are done, click 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>OK</B></span>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Note</B></span>: You can select 
 options for one or more types of run operations and save them to a properties 
 file for later reuse.</p>

<h2 class=Heading2norule>View Manager Options</h2>

<p class=Body>For details on any of the following options, see the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;"><I>StarTeam Administrator's Guide.</I></span></p>

<h3>General Tab</h3>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Include child views</p>

<p class=Body>Indicates how much of the tree to include in the run operation. 
 It is valid only when a view is selected as the source object and that 
 view's configuration is current. When synchronizing views, it applies 
 to both the selected source and target views. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Include child folders</p>

<p class=Body>Indicates how much of the tree to include in the run operation. 
 It is valid only when a folder is selected as the source object. When 
 synchronizing folders, it applies to both the selected source and target 
 folders. Default is selected.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">(Replicate) Users</p>

<p class=Body>Allows View Manager to use the original user names in the 
 Created By properties of created objects. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">(Replicate) Creation times</p>

<p class=Body>Copies creation times along with created items. When cleared, 
 object creation times are the times at which View Manager creates them. 
 If the source and target objects are the same view or folders are in the 
 same view, objects will be shared rather than added. Thus, those objects 
 have the original creation times, regardless of this option setting. Default 
 is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">(Replicate) View labels</p>

<p class=Body>Copies all view label definitions from one view to the other. 
 Depending on your missing-object option settings and the type of operation, 
 view label definitions can be copied from the source to the target and 
 the target to the source.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">(Replicate) Promotion states</p>

<p class=Body>Copies all the promotion state definitions from one view 
 to the other. Depending on your missing-object option settings and the 
 type of operation, promotion state definitions can be copied from the 
 source to the target and the target to the source. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">(Replicate) Revision labels</p>

<p class=Body>Copies the revision labels on an as-needed basis, as file 
 revisions are created. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Number of retries</p>

<p class=Body>Specifies the number of times View Manager will attempt to 
 connect to a given server. Default is 3 times.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Time between retries ___ minutes</p>

<p class=Body>Specifies the number of minutes between reconnection attempts. 
 Default is one minute but it may take a few minutes for the disconnect 
 to be detected.</p>

<h3>Missing Objects Tab</h3>

<p class=Body>These options do not apply to copy-to-target operations because, 
 in a copy-to-target operation, everything is missing from the target.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Add projects to the target</p>

<p class=Body>This option is always disabled.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Add views to the target</p>

<p class=Body>Allows views that exist only in the source object to be shared 
 to the target object; such views are copied in entirety to the target 
 project. This option includes the view, its child views, their folders 
 and files, recursively. Default is selected.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Add folders to the target</p>

<p class=Body>Allows that exist only in the source object to be shared 
 to the target object; such folders are shared in entirety to the target 
 object. This option includes the folder, its child folders and files, 
 recursively. Default is selected.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Add files to the target</p>

<p class=Body>Allows files that exist only in the source object to be shared 
 to the target object. No file is shared based on this option unless its 
 folder (or an equivalent folder) exists in both the source and target 
 objects. Default is selected.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Delete folders from the source</p>

<p class=Body>Allows folders that exist only in the source object to be 
 deleted from the source object; such folders are deleted in entirety from 
 the source object. This option includes the folder, its child folders 
 and files, recursively. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Delete files from the source</p>

<p class=Body>Allows files that exist only in the source object to be deleted 
 from the source object. No file is deleted based on this option unless 
 its folder (or an equivalent folder) exists in both the source and the 
 target. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Add projects to the source</p>

<p class=Body>This option is always disabled. </p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Add views to the source</p>

<p class=Body>Allows views that exist only in the target object to be added 
 to the source object; such views are copied in entirety to the source 
 project. This option includes the view, its child views, their folders 
 and files, recursively. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Add folders to the source</p>

<p class=Body>Allows folders that exist only in the target object to be 
 shared to the source object; such folders are shared in entirety to the 
 source object. This option includes the folder, its child folders and 
 files, recursively. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Add files to the source</p>

<p class=Body>Allows files that exist only in the target object to be shared 
 to the source object. No file is shared based on this option unless its 
 folder (or an equivalent folder) exists in both the source and target 
 objects. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Delete folders from the target</p>

<p class=Body>Allows folders that exist only in the target object to be 
 deleted from the target object; such folders are deleted in entirety from 
 the target object. This option includes the folder, its child folders 
 and files, recursively. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Delete files from the target</p>

<p class=Body>Allows files that exist only in the target object to be deleted 
 from the target object. No file is added based on this option unless its 
 folder (or an equivalent folder) exists in both the source and target 
 objects. Default is cleared.</p>

<h3>Merge Tab</h3>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Record each merge</p>

<p class=Body>Records the revisions involved in a given merge. Recording 
 and tracking merges goes hand-in-hand. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Use merge tracking for merge resolution</p>

<p class=Body>Uses the most recent recorded merge as a basis for the status 
 of a given file during a preview or for the actual merge operation. Without 
 merge tracking, corresponding files are merged as long as they are not 
 identical. With merge tracking, the files can be very different and still 
 not require a merge operation. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Use source as common ancestor</p>

<p class=Body>Bases the merge on the source file from the last recorded 
 merge, as well as the pair of files being merged. Without merge tracking, 
 the most recent common ancestor is used to perform the three-way merge. 
 The common ancestor is a historical revision with the same revision number 
 in both views. Default is selected.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Use target as common ancestor</p>

<p class=Body>Bases the merge on the target file from the last recorded 
 merge as well as the pair of files being merged. Without merge tracking, 
 the most recent common ancestor is used to perform the three-way merge. 
 The common ancestor is a historical revision with the same revision number 
 in both views. Default is cleared.</p>

<h3>Merge Utility Tab</h3>

<p class=Body>The options on this tab are valid only if the run operation 
 is source-to-target or bidirectional. Default utilities are Visual Merge 
 and Visual Diff. If you prefer to use other merge and comparison utilities, 
 you can select alternates and designate options to be used with them. 
 </p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Visual Merge</p>

<p class=Body>Designates Visual Merge as your merge utility on Windows 
 platforms. Default is selected.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Ignore whitespace</p>

<p class=Body>When comparing two lines of text files, ignores trailing 
 white space and treats all other strings of white space as equal in length. 
 Default is cleared.</p>

 to the tip revision of the file to be merged.</p>

<p class=Body-Indent-1>$usertip, used as a place holder for the path to 
 the local working file to be merged.</p>

<p class=Body-Indent-1>$basefile, used as a place holder for the path to 
 the common ancestor for the $branchtip and $usertip files.</p>

<p class=Body-Indent-1>$resultfile, used as a place holder for the path 
 to the file that will store the output from the merged file.</p>

<p class=Body>This option is enabled only if the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Alternate 
 merge utility</B></span> option has been selected. Default is blank.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Alternate comparison utility</p>

<p class=Body-Indent-1>$file1, used as a place holder for the path to the 
 first of the two files to be compared.</p>

<p class=Body-Indent-1>$file2, used as a place holder for the path to the 
 second of the two files to be compared.</p>

<p class=Body>This option is enabled only if the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Alternate 
 comparison utility</B></span> check box has been selected. Default is blank.</p>

<h3>Locking Tab</h3>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Exclusively lock server on run</p>

 the source and/or the target depending on the direction of the operation. 
 This option does not apply to files that have changed in both the source 
 and target. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Break lock if file needs to be checked in</p>

<p class=Body>When selected, allows View Manager to check in files even 
 if they are locked by someone else. You must have the access rights necessary 
 to break locks. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Resolve differences for text files</p>

<p class=Body>Files can be resolved automatically by using the merge utility 
 or by substituting the existing source or target file for the merged file. 
 </p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Merge automatically</p>

<p class=Body>When selected, View Manager merges any text file that has 
 no conflicts. When cleared, View Manager does no automatic merging of 
 text files. Default is cleared.</p>

 style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Use existing file as merged file option</B></span> 
 is enabled. Default is cleared.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Resolve differences for binary files</p>

<p class=Body>Binary files cannot be merged by View Manager; however, binary

 existing source or target file for the merged file. </p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Use existing file as merged file</p>

<p class=Body>When selected, allows user to use either the source or target
