<h1>Understanding the Vault</h1>

<p class=Body>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body>Server configurations created with StarTeam 6.0 or earlier 
 releases use Native-I vaults for storage, but configurations created &nbsp;with 
 StarTeam Server 2005 or later releases use the new Native-II format. The 
 new Native-II architecture has been created because it allows:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Larger file revisions</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>More locations to store 
 archives </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Faster, more efficient 
 performance</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=Body>After you upgrade and start a server configuration created 
 with StarTeam 6.0 or earlier, the server configuration uses the Native-II 
 vault for all new files put under application control. However, it continues 
 to use the prior Native-I vault for existing application files until they 
 converted manually or as part of a background conversion process. </p>

<p class=Body>New server configurations created with StarTeam 2005 or later 
 releases use only Native-II vaults.</p>

<p class=Body>Native-II vaults store each revision of a file in a separate 
 archive file, which allows each revision to be much larger than before. 
 Compression is used for files that compress well (10% or better), but 
 delta storage of archives has been eliminated. This format speeds up revision 
 retrieval.</p>

<p class=Body>Native-I vaults store all revisions for the same file in 
 the same archive file, which is limited to a maximum size of 2GB for StarTeam 
 releases prior to 5.3 and 4GB for releases StarTeam 5.3 through 6.0. &nbsp;While 
 delta storage and compression can reduce the size of this file, it continues 
 to grow with additional revisions.</p>

<p class=Body>Eventually, the Server will support only Native-II vaults. 
 </p>

<p class=Body>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How the Vaults Differ</h2>

<p class=Body>Native-I and Native-II vaults both contain an Attachments 
 folder, the server log files, and other server-related items. For example, 
 both vaults store .dmp files and trace files, if they exist. See the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;"><I>StarTeam Installation Guide</I></span> for more 
 information.</p>

<p class=Body>However, the basic structure of the vaults differs.</p>

<p class=Body>A Native-I vault has only one Vault folder, a subfolder of 
 the repository path. The Vault folder has one Archive and one Cache folder. 
 Initially these folders are subfolders of the Vault folder but you can 
 change their locations later, if necessary. For example, if the disk becomes 
 full, you may need to move one or both of these folders (and their files) 
 to create space for additional files and revisions.</p>

<p class=Body>A Native-II vault has several hives, each of which has its 
 own Archives folder and Cache folder. If one hive fills up, you can add 
 another without having to change any data locations or move any archive 
 files. When a server configuration has more than one hive, the server 
 adds files to each of them in turn before reusing the first hive’s archive 
 path.</p>

<h2>How the Vaults Work</h2>

<h3>Adding Files</h3>

<p class=Body>When adding a file to the Native-II vault, the Server stores 
 the revision in a temporary folder, then computes the MD5 value of its 
 contents and checks how well it compresses. If the compression is 10% 
 or greater, the server moves the compressed version to the hive's archive 
 and the uncompressed version to the hive's cache. If the revision doesn't 
 compress well, the uncompressed version is moved to the hive’s archive. 
 </p>

<p class=Body>The MD5 value is converted to a hex string and is used as 
 the archive file’s name. A .gz extension is used if the file archive is 
 compressed. If an archive file already exists with that name, no new archive 
 file is created—although the application file’s properties are updated 
 to identify the hive in which the revision is stored, the use of compression, 
 and the archive file’s name.</p>

<p class=Body>To add a new file to a Native-I vault, the Server simply 
 creates a new archive file. </p>

<h3>Check-in Operations</h3>

<p class=Body>When checking a file revision into a Native-II vault, the 
 Server stores the revision in a temporary folder in the next hive in the 
 hive rotation. Then the server computes the MD5 value of the file's contents. 
 If an archive file with the same name already exists in the hive, no new 
 archive file is created, although the file revision’s properties are updated. 
 If such a file does not exist, a new archive file is created. If the application 
 file has been identified as one that compresses well, the file revision 
 is compressed and placed in the hive’s archive with a .gz extension. Otherwise 
 the uncompressed version is moved to the hive’s archive, while the uncompressed 
 version is moved to the hive’s cache. </p>

<p class=Body>To check a file revision into a Native-I vault, the server 
 first makes a copy of the archive file, then adds the new revision or 
 new forward delta to the archive file and deletes the copy.</p>

<h3>Check-out Operations</h3>

<p class=Body>When checking out a file revision from a Native-II vault, 
 the Server checks the revision's hive ID and archive file name. Then it 
 retrieves the file revision from the specified hive’s cache or archive. 
 For StarTeam 6.0 or earlier clients, it checks the cache first, because 
 the uncompressed version must be sent. For StarTeam 2005 and later clients, 
 it sends the archive file directly.</p>

<p class=Body>To check out a file revision from a Native-I vault, the Server 
 first checks the cache. If the file is there, it is sent to the client. 
 If the file is not there, it is retrieved from the archive and sent. Retrieving 
 a particular revision from the archive file may require the application 
 of several deltas.</p>
