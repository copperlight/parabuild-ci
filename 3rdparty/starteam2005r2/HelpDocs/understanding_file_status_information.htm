<h1>Understanding File Status Information</h1>

<p class=Body>The operations you can perform on a particular file depend 
 upon the status of the file. A successful check-in or check-out operation 
 updates the status of your working file to Current, unless you check out 
 a historical revision or delete the file. This list includes all status 
 classes and shows their effects on check-ins and check-outs.</p>

<h3 class=Body>Current</h3>

<p class=Body>The tip revision of this file is in your working folder. 
 </p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-ins</B></span>: Does not 
 affect the file revision in the repository.</p>

<p class=Body
	style="font-weight: bold;">Check-outs: <span style="font-weight: normal;">.Does 
 not affect the file revision on your workstation.</span></p>

<h3>Missing</h3>

<p class=Body>The file is not in your working folder.</p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-ins</B></span>: Not applicable. 
 If a file has a Missing status, it is not in your working folder, so it 
 cannot be checked in. </p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-outs</B></span>: Copies 
 the file to your working folder. If a file has a Missing status, you will 
 be asked if you want to check it out when you open it. You can also check 
 it out manually.</p>

<h3>Merge</h3>

<p class=Body>The file in your working folder has been modified, but is 
 not based on the tip (latest) revision of this file. This status usually 
 occurs when you and another person have both been working on a file, but 
 the other person has checked it in before you.</p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-ins</B></span>: Unless 
 you force a check-in, Visual Merge launches. If the file is a text file, 
 Visual Merge can reconcile the differences between it and the tip revision. 
 If the file is binary, you may be able to merge the working version and 
 the tip revision by using the application in which the file was created. 
 </p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-outs</B></span>: Not allowed, 
 unless you force the check-out. The file changes you have made in your 
 working folder will be lost. </p>

<h3>Modified</h3>

<p class=Body>Your working file has been altered and is based on the tip 
 revision of this file. </p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-ins</B></span>: Unless 
 someone else has the file locked, you can check in the file.</p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-outs</B></span>: Not allowed 
 unless you force the check-out. Your changes will be lost if you check 
 out the file, because it overwrites the file in your working folder.</p>

<h3>Out of Date</h3>

<p class=Body>The file in your working folder is an outdated revision of 
 the file. If you need the current revision, you should check it out.</p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-ins</B></span>: Not allowed, 
 unless you force the check-in. Checking in an Out Of Date file overwrites 
 the changes made to the tip revision of the file with your older file 
 revision.</p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-outs</B></span>: Checking 
 out an Out Of Date file makes the file in your working folder Current. 
 </p>

<h3>Not in View</h3>

<p class=Body>The file is in your working folder, but not in the project 
 view. &nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-ins</B></span>: Not applicable. 
 Files with the Not in View status cannot be checked in. However, you can 
 add them to the project with the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Add 
 Files</B></span> command.</p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-outs</B></span>: Not applicable. 
 Files with the Not in View status are not in the project view, so they 
 cannot be checked out. </p>

<h3>Unknown</h3>

<p class=Body>The file in the working folder has the same name as a file 
 in the view, but the file in the view has not been checked out from the 
 repository. You may have copied it from another location. </p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-ins</B></span>: Not allowed, 
 unless you force the operation. If the file status is Unknown, the consequences 
 of this action are also unknown, except that the file in your working 
 folder becomes the tip revision in the repository. Before forcing a check-in, 
 try to identify the file by using <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Update 
 Status</B></span> with an MD5 checksum instead of a time stamp (see <a href="setting_file_options.htm">Setting 
 File Options</a>). If you still cannot identify the file, compare the 
 file in your working folder to the current tip revision.</p>

<p class=Body><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Check-outs</B></span>: Allowed, 
 if you merge the file in your working folder with the tip revision. However, 
 because the first revision acts as the ancestor file for the merge, many 
 parts of the files may be in conflict. Instead of merging, you may prefer 
 to force a check-out or check-in. </p>

<p class=Body>If the file status is Unknown, the consequences of forcing 
 a check-out are also unknown, except that this action also overwrites 
 the file in your working directory. Before forcing a check-out, try to 
 identify the file by using <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Update Status</B></span> 
 with an MD5 checksum. If you still cannot identify the file, compare the 
 file in your working folder to the current tip revision.</p>
