<h1>Understanding StarTeam to PVCS Interoperability</h1>

<p class=Body
	style="margin-top: 7.00pt;"><font style="color: #000000;"
										color=#000000>The following functions 
 in StarTeam result in equivalent operations in PVCS:</font></p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Adding a file. Files 
 cannot be added directly to a child view in StarTeam. Instead, they must 
 be added to the root view, then automatically shared to the child view 
 and set to branch on change. If you want a file to exist only in the root 
 view, you must explicitly delete it from each child view before it branches 
 in that view. When a file branches in a child view, it branches in PVCS 
 and acquires a floating label for that branch.</p></li>
	
	<p class=Bullet-1-text>Never delete a file from the root view or from 
 a child view that has its own child views. If a file is deleted from a 
 view and not deleted from its child views,<span style="font-weight: bold;"><B> 
 F6</B></span> restores the file to the view and creates a second copy of the 
 file in each child view.</p>
	
	<p class=Bullet-1-text>Files that you add via StarTeam are immediately 
 accessible as PVCS archives from the PVCS command line. However, from 
 the PVCS graphical user interface, you <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>must</B></span> 
 use the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Import Archive</B></span> command 
 to make the archive visible.</p>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Checking in a file.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Getting any revision 
 of a file.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Checking out a file.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Locking and unlocking 
 a file in the root view or a child view in which the file has branched. 
 If a file has not branched in the child view and you lock it from the 
 child view, PVCS is unaware of the lock.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Unlocking the file for 
 a former user and relocking it for the current user (that is, breaking 
 a lock) if PVCS security was disabled when the server started. Security 
 is considered disabled if the user who locked the file has the empty string 
 as a password.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Creating views/branches. 
 Because views created in StarTeam become branches in PVCS, the application 
 does not allow a PVCS file to be branched into more than one view with 
 the same name. To work with PVCS branches, child views created in StarTeam 
 must have the same root folder as their parent views.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Turning views into branches 
 with floating labels. StarTeam does not create a branch in the PVCS archive 
 for a file unless the file’s behavior is Branch on Change and a revision 
 of that file has been checked into the new view. The appropriate revision 
 is branched, but revision numbers in PVCS and StarTeam may differ. Consequently, 
 reference views never appear in the PVCS archives and should be avoided 
 in projects that wrap PVCS archives.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=Body>Because StarTeam is a true client-server application, all 
 archive repository time stamps are translated to the time zone of the 
 server, then forwarded to PVCS. In this way, clients in different time 
 zones can work on the same set of files and still maintain a valid chronology 
 for the revisions. It is very important to keep the times on all workstations 
 and servers accurate.</p>

<p class=Body>The following functions in StarTeam are not currently translated 
 in PVCS.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Renaming a file. To rename 
 StarTeam files, you change the file’s name in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>File 
 Properties</I></span> dialog. If the file is a foreign file, the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Name</B></span> 
 text box is disabled.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Deleting a file. If you 
 delete a file from a view via StarTeam, PVCS does not know that it has 
 been deleted. If you delete a file with StarTeam before a revision was 
 checked in for a particular view, it does not have a branch in the PVCS 
 archive for the view from which it was deleted. In this case, to restore 
 the deleted file is not a simple <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Add 
 File</B></span> operation. You must open both the view from which you deleted 
 the file and its parent view, then share the file from the parent view 
 to the child view. These actions restore the file and its history.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Sharing a file.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Changing the working 
 path for a folder.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Locking and unlocking 
 a file in a child view in which the file has <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>not</B></span> 
 branched. If you lock a file from a child view in which it has <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>not</I></span> 
 branched, PVCS is unaware of the lock.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Linking. You can link 
 items, but the links are available only in StarTeam.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Labeling views or files. 
 StarTeam labels are not translated in any way into PVCS.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Changing file descriptions. 
 StarTeam can create a PVCS file description as it adds a file to the project, 
 but it does not record any changes made to that description.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Breaking a lock if PVCS 
 security is enabled. Security is considered enabled if the user who locked 
 the file had a non-empty password when the server started. To break a 
 lock, log onto another StarTeam client as the person who locked the item,and 
 then unlock the file. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet-1><p class=Bullet-1>Changing the compression 
 options of Native-I or Native-II files. This option does not appear for 
 foreign files in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>File Properties</I></span> 
 dialog.</p></li>
