<p><a href="http://www.part.net/quartz.html">Quartz</a> is a job scheduling
system that can be integrated with, or used along side virtually any other
software system.  The term "job scheduler" seems to conjure different ideas for
different people.  As you read this tutorial, you should be able to get a firm
idea of what <i>we</i> mean when we use this term, but in short, a job scheduler
is a system that is responsible for executing (or notifying) other software
components when a pre-determined (scheduled) time arrives.</p>

<p>Quartz is quite flexible, and contains multiple usage paradigms that can be
used separately or together, in order to achieve your desired behavior, and
enable you to write your code in the manner that seems most 'natural' to your
project.</p>

<p>Quartz is very light-weight, and requires very little setup/configuration - it
can actually be used 'out-of-the-box' if your needs are relatively basic.</p>

<p>Quartz is fault-tolerant, and can persist ('remember') your scheduled jobs
between system restarts.</p>

<p>Although Quartz is extremely useful for simply running certain system
processes on given schedules, the full potential of Quartz can be realized when
you learn how to use it to drive the flow of your application's business
processes.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>Quartz is distributed as a small java library (.jar file) that contains all
of the core Quartz functionality.  The main interface (API) to this
functionality is the <i>Scheduler</i> interface.  It provides simple operations
such as scheduling/unscheduling jobs, starting/stopping/pausing the
scheduler.</p>

<p>If you wish to schedule your own software components for execution they must
implement the simple <i>Job</i> interface, which contains the method
<i>execute()</i>.  If you wish to have components notified when a scheduled
fire-time arrives, then the components should implement either the
<i>TriggerListener</i> or <i>JobListener</i> interface.</p>

<p>The main Quartz 'process' can be started and ran within your own application,
as a stand-alone application (with an RMI interface), or within a J2EE app.
server to be used as a resource by your J2EE components.</p>

<p>This tutorial is meant to give you a quick - yet useful - primer on the
basic capabilities of Quartz, and how to use Quartz within your own software
project.  It may take you approximately one hour to read this document
end-to-end.</p>

<p>Aside from teaching you how to use Quartz, this document also aims to help
you answer the question: "is Quartz the right solution for my
project's scheduling needs?"</p>

<p>Although there are Java programming examples throughout this document, you
should find it fairly easy to follow, as long as you have rudimentary
understanding of how software is written.</p>

<p>When you're ready to actually use Quartz, the JavaDOC that is provided with
it should serve as your reference manual.  This will help you learn more of
the caveats of particular components, and provide you with more examples and
instructions.</p>

<p><b>Help!</b></p>
<p>Please provide feedback as to this document's: usefulness,
completeness, grammer errors, points of confusion, etc.  This can be done
via the Quartz user forum or mailing list that can be found at the project's

<p>Before you can use the scheduler, it needs to be instantiated (who'd have
guessed?).  To do this, you use a <i>SchedulerFactory</i>. Some users of Quartz
may keep an instance of a factory serialized in a JNDI store, others may find
it just as easy (or easier) to instantiate and use a factory instance directly
(such as in the example below).</p>

<p>Once a scheduler is instantiated, it can be started, paused, and shutdown.
Note that once a scheduler is shutdown, it cannot be restarted without being
re-instantiated.  Triggers do not fire (jobs do not execute) until the
scheduler has been started, nor while it is in the paused state.</p>

<p>Here's a quick snippet of code, that instantiates and starts a scheduler,
and schedules a job for execution:
<pre>
<font face="courier" >
  SchedulerFactory schedFact = new org.quartz.impl.StdSchedulerFactory();

  Scheduler sched = schedFact.getScheduler();

  sched.start();

  JobDetail jobDetail = new JobDetail("myJob",
                                      sched.DEFAULT_GROUP,
                                      DumbJob.class);

  SimpleTrigger trigger = new SimpleTrigger("myTrigger",
                                            sched.DEFAULT_GROUP,
                                            new Date(),
                                            null,
                                            0,
                                            0L);

  sched.scheduleJob(jobDetail, trigger);
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>As you can see, working with quartz is rather simple.  We'll now spend a
little time talking about Jobs and Triggers, so that you can more fully
understand this example.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- Jobs and Triggers                                                      --------- -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<br>
<p><a name="jobsNTriggers"/><font size="+1"><b>Jobs & Triggers</b></font></p>
<img src="sep_thing.jpg" border="0">
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>As mentioned previously, you can make Java component executable by
the scheduler simply by making it implement the <b><i>Job</i></b> interface.  Here is
the interface:
<pre>
<font face="courier" >
  package org.quartz;

  public interface Job {

    public void execute(JobExecutionContext context)
      throws JobExecutionException;
  }
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>In case you couldn't guess, when the Job's trigger fires (more on that in a
moment), the <i>execute(..)</i> method is invoked by the scheduler.  The
<i>JobExecutionContext</i> object that is passed to this method provides the
job instance with information about its "run-time" environment - a handle to
the Scheduler that executed it, a handle to the Trigger that triggered the
execution, the job's <i>JobDetail</i> object, and a few other items.</p>

<p>The <b><i>JobDetail</i></b> object is created by the Quartz client (your program)
at the time the Job is added to the scheduler.  It contains various property
settings for the Job, as well as a <b><i>JobDataMap</i></b>, which can be used to
store state information for a given instance of your job class.</p>

<p><b><i>Trigger</i></b> objects are used to trigger the execution (or 'firing') of
jobs.  When you wish to schedule a job, you instantiate a trigger and 'tune' its
properties to provide the scheduling you wish to have.  There are currently two
types of triggers, <i>SimpleTrigger</i> and <i>CronTrigger</i>.</p>
<i>SimpleTrigger</i> is handy if you need 'one-shot' execution (just single
execution of a job at a given moment in time), or if you need to fire a job
at a given time, and have it repeat N times, with a delay of T between
executions.  <i>CronTrigger</i> is useful if you wish to have triggering based
on calendar-like schedules - such as "every Friday, at noon" or "at 10:15 on
the 10th day of every month."</p>

<p>Why Jobs <u>AND</u> Triggers? Many job schedulers do not have separate notions
of jobs and triggers.  Some define a 'job' as simply an execution time (or
schedule) along with some small job identifier.  Others are much like the union
of Quartz's job and trigger objects.  While developing Quartz, we decided that
it made sense to create a separation between the schedule and the work to be
performed on that schedule.  This has (in our opinion) many benefits.

<p>For example,  Jobs can be created and stored in the job scheduler independent of a
trigger, and many triggers can be associated with the same job. Another benefit
of this loose-coupling is the ability to configure jobs that remain in the
scheduler after their associated triggers have expired, so that that it can
be rescheduled later, without having to re-define it. It also allows you to
modify or replace a trigger without having to re-define its associated job.</p>

<p><b>Identifiers</b></p>
<p>Jobs and Triggers are given identifying names as they are registered with
the Quartz scheduler.  Jobs and triggers can also be placed into 'groups' which
can be useful for organizing your jobs and triggers into categories for later
maintenance.  The name of a job or trigger must be unique within its group -
or in other words, the true identifier of a job or trigger is its name +
group.</p>

<br>
<p>Now that you have a general idea about what Jobs and Triggers are, let's
talk about them in some more detail.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- Jobs                                                                           --------- -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<br>
<p><a name="jobsMore"/><font size="+1"><b>More About Jobs & JobDetails</b></font></p>
<img src="sep_thing.jpg" border="0">
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>As you've seen, Jobs are rather easy to implement.  There are just a few
more things that you need to understand about the nature of jobs, about the
<i>execute(..)</i> method of the <i>Job</i> interface, and about
<i>JobDetail</i>s.</p>

<p>While a class that you implement is the actual "job", Quartz needs to be
informed about various attributes that you may wish the job to have.  This is
done via the <i>JobDetail</i> class, which was mentioned briefly in the previous
section. Software 'archaeologists' may be interested to know that in an older
incarnation of Quartz, the implementation of the functionality of
<i>JobDetail</i> was imposed upon the implementor of each Job class by having all
of <i>JobDetail</i>'s 'getter' methods on the <i>Job</i> interface itself.  This
forced a cumbersome job of re-implementing virtually identical code on every
Job class - which was really dumb... thus we created the <i>JobDetail</i>
class.</p>

<p>Let's take a moment now to discuss a bit about the 'nature' of Jobs and the
life-cycle of job instances within Quartz.  First lets take a look back at some
of that snippet of code we saw earlier:
<pre>
<font face="courier" >
  JobDetail jobDetail = new JobDetail("myJob",             // job name
                                      sched.DEFAULT_GROUP, // job group
                                      DumbJob.class);        // the java class to execute

  SimpleTrigger trigger = new SimpleTrigger("myTrigger",
                                            sched.DEFAULT_GROUP,
                                            new Date(),
                                            null,
                                            0,
                                            0L);

  sched.scheduleJob(jobDetail, trigger);
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>Now consider the job class "DumbJob" defined as such:
<pre>
<font face="courier" >
  public class DumbJob implements Job {

    public DumbJob() {
    }

    public void execute(JobExecutionContext context)
      throws JobExecutionException
    {
      System.err.println("DumbJob is executing.");
    }
  }
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>Notice that we 'feed' the scheduler a <i>JobDetail</i> instance, and that it
refers to the job to be executed by simply providing the job's class.  Each
(and every) time the scheduler executes the job, it creates a new instance of
the class before calling its <i>execute(..)</i> method.  One of the
ramifications of this behavior is the fact that jobs must have a no-arguement
constructor. Another ramification is that it does not make sense to have
data-members defined on the job class - as their values would be 'cleared' every
time the job executes.</p>

<p>You may now be wanting to ask "how can I provide properties/configuration for
a Job instance?" and "how can I keep track of a job's state between
executions?"  The answer to these questions are the same: the key is the
<i>JobDataMap</i>, which is part of the <i>JobDetail</i> object.</p>

<p>The <b><i>JobDataMap</i></b> can be used to hold any number of (serializable)
objects which you wish to have made available to the job instance when it
executes.  <i>JobDataMap</i> is an implementation of the Java <i>Map</i>
interface, and has some added convenience methods for storing and retreiving
data of primitive types.</p>

<p>Here's some quick snippets of putting data into the <i>JobDataMap</i> prior
to adding the job to the scheduler:
<pre>
<font face="courier" >
  jobDetail.getJobDataMap().put("jobSays", "Hello World!");
  jobDetail.getJobDataMap().put("myFloatValue", 3.141f);
  jobDetail.getJobDataMap().put("myStateData", new ArrayList());
</font>
</pre>
</p>
<p>Here's a quick example of getting data from the <i>JobDataMap</i> during
the job's execution:
<pre>
<font face="courier" >
  public class DumbJob implements Job {

    public DumbJob() {
    }

    public void execute(JobExecutionContext context)
      throws JobExecutionException
    {
      String instName = context.getJobDetail().getName();
      String instGroup = context.getJobDetail().getGroup();

      JobDataMap dataMap = context.getJobDetail().getJobDataMap();

      String jobSays = dataMap.getString("jobSays");
      float myFloatValue = dataMap.getFloat("myFloatValue");
      ArrayList state = (ArrayList)dataMap.get("myStateData");
      state.add(new Date());

      System.err.println("Instance " + instName + " of DumbJob says: " + jobSays);
    }
  }
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>If you use a persistent <i>JobStore</i> (discussed in the JobStore section of
this tutorial) you should use some care in deciding what you place in the
<i>JobDataMap</i>, because the object in it will be serialized, and they therefore
become prone to class-versioning problems.  Obviously standard Java types should
be very safe, but beyond that, anytime someone changes the definition of a class
for which you have serialized instances, care has to be taken not to break
compatibility.  Further information on this topic can be found in this Java Developer
Connection Tech Tip:
<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/TechTips/2000/tt0229.html#tip1">Serialization In The Real World</a>.</p>

<p><b>Stateful vs. Non-Stateful Jobs</b></p>
<p>Now, some additional notes about a job's state data (aka <i>JobDataMap</i>):
A Job instance can be defined as "stateful" or "non-stateful".  Non-stateful
jobs only have their <i>JobDataMap</i> stored at the time they are added to the
scheduler.  This means that any changes made to the contents of the job data
map during execution of the job will be lost, and will not seen by the job the
next time it executes.  You have probably guessed, a stateful job is just the
opposite - its <i>JobDataMap</i> is re-stored after every execution of the
job.  One side-effect of making a job stateful is that it cannot be executed
concurrently.  Or in other words: if a job is stateful, and a trigger attempts
to 'fire' the job while it is already executing, the trigger will block (wait)
until the previous execution completes.</p>

<p>You 'mark' a Job as stateful by having it implement the <b><i>StatefulJob</i></b>
interface, rather than the <i>Job</i> interface.</p>

<p>One final point on this topic that may or may not be obvious by now:
You can create a single job class, and store many 'instances' of it within the
scheduler by creating multiple instances of <i>JobDetail</i>s - each with its
own set of properties and <i>JobDataMap</i> - and adding them all to the
scheduler.</p>

<p><b>Other Attributes Of Jobs</b></p>
<p>Here's a quick summary of the other properties which can be defined for a
job instance via the <i>JobDetail</i> object:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Durability</b> - if a job is non-durable, it is automatically deleted from the
    scheduler once there are no longer any active triggers associated with it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Volatility</b> - if a job is volatile, it is not persisted between re-starts
    of the Quartz scheduler.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>RequestsRecovery</b> - if a job "requests recovery", and it is executing during
    the time of a 'hard shutdown' of the scheduler (i.e. the process it is
    running within crashes, or the machine is shut off), then it is re-executed
    when the scheduler is started again.  In this case, the
    <i>JobExecutionContext.isRecovering()</i> method will return true.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>JobListeners</b> - a job can have a set of zero or more <i>JobListener</i>s
    associated with it.  When the job executes, the listeners are notified.
    More discussion on JobListeners can be found in the section of this document
    that is dedicated to the topic of TriggerListeners & JobListeners.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>The Job.execute(..) Method</b></p>
<p>Finally, we need to inform you of a few details of the <i>Job.execute(..)</i>
method.  The <u>only</u> type of exception (including RuntimeExceptions) that
you are allowed to throw from the execute method is the
<i>JobExecutionException</i>.  Because of this, you should generally wrap the
entire contents of the execute method with a 'try-catch' block.  You should also
spend some time looking at the documentation for the
<i>JobExecutionException</i>, as your job can use it to provide the scheduler
various directives as to how you want the exception to be handled.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- Triggers                                                                      --------- -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<br>
<p><a name="triggersMore"/><font size="+1"><b>More About Triggers</b></font></p>
<img src="sep_thing.jpg" border="0">
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>Like jobs, triggers are relatively easy to work with, but do contain a
variety of customizable options that you need to be aware of and understand
before you can make full use of Quartz.  Also, as noted earlier, there are
different types of triggers, that can be selected from to meet different
scheduling needs.</p>

<p><b>Calendars</b></p>
<p>Quartz <i>Calendar</i> objects (not java.util.Calendar objects) can be
associated with triggers at the time the trigger is stored in the scheduler.
Calendars are useful for excluding blocks of time from the the trigger's
firing schedule.  For instance, you could create a trigger that fires a job
every weekday at 9:30 am, but then add a <i>Calendar</i> that excludes all of
the business's holidays.</p>

<p>Calendar's can be any serializable objects that implement the <i>Calendar</i>
interface, which looks like this:
<pre>
<font face="courier" >
  package org.quartz;

  public interface Calendar {

    public boolean isTimeIncluded(long timeStamp);

    public long getNextIncludedTime(long timeStamp);

  }
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>Notice that the parameters to these methods are of the <i>long</i> type.  As
you may guess, they are timestamps in millisecond format.  This means that
calendars can 'block out' sections of time as narrow as a millisecond.  Most
likely, you'll be interested in 'blocking-out' entire days.  As a convenience,
Quartz includes the class <i>org.quartz.impl.HolidayCalendar</i>, which does
just that.</p>

<p>Calendars must be instantiated and registered with the scheduler via the
<i>addCalendar(..)</i> method.  If you use HolidayCalendar, after instantiating
it, you should use its <i>addExcludedDate(Date date)</i> method in order to
populate it with the days you wish to have excluded from scheduling.  The same
calendar instance can be used with multiple calendars such as this:
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  HolidayCalendar cal = new HolidayCalendar();
  cal.addExcludedDate( someDate );

  sched.addCalendar("myHolidays", cal, false);

  SimpleTrigger trigger = new SimpleTrigger("myTrigger",
                                            sched.DEFAULT_GROUP,
                                            new Date(),
                                            null,
                                            SimpleTrigger.REPEAT_INDEFINITELY,
                                            60L * 1000L);
  trigger.setCalendarName("myHolidays");

  // .. schedule job with trigger

  SimpleTrigger trigger2 = new SimpleTrigger("myTrigger",
                                             sched.DEFAULT_GROUP,
                                             new Date(),
                                             null,
                                             5,
                                             5L * 24L * 60L * 60L * 1000L);

  trigger2.setCalendarName("myHolidays");

  // .. schedule job with trigger2
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>The details of the values passed in the SimpleTrigger constructors will be
explained in the next section.  For now, just believe that the code above
creates two triggers: one that will repeat every 60 seconds forever, and one
that will repeat five times with a five day interval between firings.  However, any
of the firings that would have occurred during the period excluded by the calendar
will be skipped.</p>

<p><b>Misfire Instructions</b></p>
<p>Another important property of a <i>Trigger</i> is its "misfire instruction".
A misfire occurs if a persistent trigger "misses" its firing time because of
the scheduler being shutdown.  The different trigger types have different
misfire instructions available to them.  By default they use a
'smart policy' instruction - which has dynamic behavior based on trigger
type and configuration.  When the scheduler starts, it searches for any
persistent triggers that have misfired, and it then updates each of them based
on their individually configured misfire instructions. When you start using
Quartz in your own projects, you should make yourself familiar with the
misfire instructions that are defined on the given trigger types, and explained
in their JavaDOC.  More specific information about misfire instructions will
be given under each trigger type's section of this document.  The misfire
instruction for a given trigger instance can be configured using the
<i>setMisfireInstruction(..)</i> method.</p>

<p><b>TriggerUtils</b></p>
<p>The <i>TriggerUtils</i> class (in the org.quartz.helpers package) contains
conveniences to help you create triggers and dates without having to monkey
around with java.util.Calendar objects.  Use this class to easily make triggers
that fire every minute, hour, day, week, month, etc.  Also use this class
to generate dates that are rounded to the nearest second, minute or
hour - this can be very useful for setting trigger start-times.</p>

<p><b>TriggerListeners</b></p>
<p>Finally, triggers may have registered listeners, just as jobs may.  Objects
implementing the <i>TriggerListener</i> interface will receive notifications
as a trigger is fired.</p>

<br>
<p>Now we'll spend a little time talking about the individual trigger
types...</p>

<p><i>SimpleTrigger</i> should meet your needs if you need to have a job
execute exactly once at a specific moment in time, or at a specific moment in
time followed by repeats at a specific interval.</p>

<p>With this description, you may not find it surprising to find that the
properties of a SimpleTrigger include: a start-time, and end-time, a repeat
count, and a repeat interval.  All of these properties are exactly what you'd
expect them to be, with only a couple special notes related to the end-time
property.</p>

<p>The repeat count can be zero, a positive integer, or the constant value
<i>SimpleTrigger.REPEAT_INDEFINITELY</i>.  The repeat interval property must
be zero, or a positive long value, and represents a number of milliseconds.
Note that a repeat interval of zero will cause 'repeat count' firings of the
trigger to happen concurrently (or as close to concurrently as the scheduler
can manage).</p>

<p>If you're not already familiar with the java.util.Calendar class, you may
find it helpful for computing your trigger fire-times, depending on the
start-time (or end-time) that you're trying to create.</p>

<p>The end-time property (if it is specified) over-rides the repeat count
property.  This can be useful if you wish to create a trigger such as one that
fires every 10 seconds until a given moment in time -- rather than having to
compute the number of times it would repeat between the start-time and the
end-time, you can simply specify the end-time and then use a repeat count of
REPEAT_INDEFINITELY (you could even specify a repeat count of some huge number
that is sure to be more than the number of times the trigger will actually fire
before the end-time arrives).</p>

<p><i>SimpleTrigger</i> has a few different constructors, but we'll examine
this one, and use it in the few examples that follow:
<pre>
<font face="courier" >
  public SimpleTrigger(String name, String group, Date startTime,
                       Date endTime, int repeatCount, long repeatInterval)
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>SimpleTrigger Example 1 - Create a trigger that fires exactly once, ten
seconds from now:
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis() + 10000L;

  SimpleTrigger trigger = new SimpleTrigger("myTrigger",
                                            sched.DEFAULT_GROUP,
                                            new Date(startTime),
                                            null,
                                            0,
                                            0L);
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>SimpleTrigger Example 2 - Create a trigger that fires immediately, then
repeats every 60 seconds, forever:
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  SimpleTrigger trigger = new SimpleTrigger("myTrigger",
                                            sched.DEFAULT_GROUP,
                                            new Date(),
                                            null,
                                            SimpleTrigger.REPEAT_INDEFINITELY,
                                            60L * 1000L);
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>SimpleTrigger Example 3 - Create a trigger that fires immediately, then
repeats every 10 seconds until 40 seconds from now:
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis() + 40000L;

  SimpleTrigger trigger = new SimpleTrigger("myTrigger",
                                            sched.DEFAULT_GROUP,
                                            new Date(),
                                            new Date(endTime),
                                            SimpleTrigger.REPEAT_INDEFINITELY,
                                            10L * 1000L);
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>SimpleTrigger Example 4 - Create a trigger that fires on March 17 of the year
2002 at precisely 10:30 am, and repeats 5 times (for a total of 6 firings) -
with a 30 second delay between each firing:
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  java.util.Calendar cal = new java.util.GregorianCalendar(2002, cal.MARCH, 17);
  cal.set(cal.HOUR, 10);
  cal.set(cal.MINUTE, 30);
  cal.set(cal.SECOND, 0);
  cal.set(cal.MILLISECOND, 0);

  Data startTime = cal.getTime()

  SimpleTrigger trigger = new SimpleTrigger("myTrigger",
                                            sched.DEFAULT_GROUP,
                                            startTime,
                                            null,
                                            5,
                                            30L * 1000L);
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<p>Spend some time looking at the other constructors (and property setters)
available on SimpleTrigger, so that you can use the one most convenient to
what you want to accomplish.</p>


<p><b>SimpleTrigger Misfire Instructions</b></p>
<p>SimpleTrigger has several instructions that can be used to inform Quartz
what it should do when a misfire occurs.  (Misfire situations were introduced
in the <a href="#triggersMore">More About Triggers</a> section of this
tutorial). These instructions are defined as constants on SimpleTrigger itself
(including JavaDOC describing their behavior). The instructions include:
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_NOW
  MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_EXISTING_REPEAT_COUNT
  MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_REMAINING_REPEAT_COUNT
  MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NEXT_WITH_REMAINING_COUNT
  MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NEXT_WITH_EXISTING_COUNT
</font>
</pre>

<p>You should recall from the earlier discussion of mis-fire instructions that
all triggers have the
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  Trigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_SMART_POLICY
</font>
</pre>
instruction available for use, and this instruction is also the default for all
trigger types.</p>

<p>If the 'smart policy' instruction is used, SimpleTrigger dynamically chooses
between its various MISFIRE instructions, based on the configuration and state
of the given SimpleTrigger instance.  The JavaDOC for the
<i>SimpleTrigger.updateAfterMisfire()</i> method explains the exact details of
this dynamic behavior.</p>

<!-- CronTrigger                                                                --------- -->

<img src="sep_thing.jpg" border="0">
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p><i>CronTriggers</i> are often more useful than SimpleTrigger, if you need a
job-firing schedule that recurs based on calendar-like notions, rather than
on the exactly specified intervals of SimpleTrigger.</p>

<p>With CronTrigger, you can specify firing-schedules such as "every Friday at
noon", or "every weekday and 9:30 am", or even "every 5 minutes between 9:00 am
and 10:00 am on every Monday, Wednesday and Friday".</p>

<p><b>Cron Expressions</b></p>
<p><i>Cron-Expressions</i> are used to configure instances of
<i>CronTrigger</i>. Cron-Expressions are strings that are actually made up of
six sub-expressions, that describe individual details of the schedule. These
sub-expression are separated with white-space, and represent:
<ul>
  <li>Seconds</li>
  <li>Minutes</li>
  <li>Hours</li>
  <li>Day-of-Month</li>
  <li>Month</li>
  <li>Day-of-Week</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>An example of a complete cron-expression is the string
<font face="courier">"0 0 12 ? * WED"</font> - which means "every Wednesday at
12:00 pm".</p>

<p>Individual sub-expressions can contain ranges and/or lists.  For example,
the day of week field in the previous (which reads "WED") example could be
replaces with "MON-FRI", "MON, WED, FRI", or even "MON-WED,SAT".</p>

<p>Wild-cards (the <font face="courier">'*'</font> character) can be used to say
"every" possible value of this field.  Therefore the <font face="courier">'*'</font>
character in the "Month" field of the previous example simply means
"every month". A <font face="courier">'*'</font> in the Day-Of-Week field would
obviously mean "every day of the week".</p>

<p>All of the fields have a set of valid values that can be specified. These
values should be fairly obvious - such as the numbers 0 to 59 for seconds and
minutes, and the values 0 to 23 for hours. Day-of-Month can be any value 0-31,
but you need to be careful about how many days are in a given month!  Months
can be specified as values between 0 and 11, or by using the strings
<font face="courier">JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV and
DEC.</font>  Days-of-Week can be specified as vaules between 1 and 7
(1 = Sunday) or by using the strings <font face="courier">SUN, MON, TUE, WED,
THU, FRI and SAT</font>.</p>

<p>The <font face="courier">'/'</font> character can be used to specify
increments to values.  For example, if you put <font face="courier">'0/15'</font>
in the Minutes field, it means 'every 15 minutes, starting at minute zero'. If
you used <font face="courier">'3/20'</font> in the Minutes field, it would mean
'every 20 minutes during the hour, starting at minute three' - or in other words
it is the same as specifying <font face="courier">'3,23,43'</font> in the
Minutes field.</p>

<p>The <font face="courier">'?'</font> character is allowed for the day-of-month
and day-of-week fields.  It is used to specify "no specific value". This is
useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields, but not the
other. See the examples below (and CronTrigger JavaDOC) for clarification.</p>

<p>The <font face="courier">'L'</font> character is allowed for the day-of-month
and day-of-week fields. This character is short-hand for "last", but it has
different meaning in each of the two fields.  For example, the value "L" in the
day-of-month field means "the last day of the month" - day 31 for  January,
day 28 for February on non-leap years.  If used in the day-of-week field by
itself, it simply means "7" or "SAT". But if used in the day-of-week field
after another value, it means "the last xxx day of the month" - for example
"6L" or "FRIL" both mean "the last friday of the month".  When using the 'L'
option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll
get confusing results.</p>

<p>Here are a few more examples of expressions and their meanings - you can
find even more in the JavaDOC for CronTrigger</p>

<p>CronTrigger Example 1 - an expression to create a trigger that simply fires
every 5 minutes</p>
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  "0 0/5 * * * ?"
</font>
</pre>

<p>CronTrigger Example 2 - an expression to create a trigger that fires
every 5 minutes, at 10 seconds after the minute (i.e. 10:00:10 am,
10:05:10 am, etc.).</p>
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  "10 0/5 * * * ?"
</font>
</pre>

<p>CronTrigger Example 3 - an expression to create a trigger that fires at
10:30, 11:30, 12:30, and 13:30, on every Wednesday and Friday.</p>
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  "0 30 10-13 ? * WED,FRI"
</font>
</pre>

<p>CronTrigger Example 4 - an expression to create a trigger that fires every
half hour between the hours of 8 am and 10 am on the 5th and 20th of every month.
Note that the trigger will NOT fire at 10:00 am, just at 8:00, 8:30, 9:00 and
9:30</p>
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  "0 0/30 8-9 * 5,20 ?"
</font>
</pre>

<br>
<p>Note that some scheduling requirements are too complicated to express with
a single trigger - such as "every 5 minutes between 9:00 am and 10:00 am, and
every 20 minutes between 1:00 pm and 10:00 pm".  The solution in this scenario
is to simply create two triggers, and register both of them to run the same
job.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- Listeners                                                                    --------- -->

<img src="sep_thing.jpg" border="0">
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>Listeners are objects that you create to perform actions based on events
occuring within the scheduler.  As you can probably guess, <i>TriggerListeners</i>
receive events related to triggers, and <i>JobListeners</i> receive events related to
jobs.</p>

<p>Trigger-related events include: trigger firings, trigger mis-firings (discussed in the
"Triggers" section of this document), and trigger completions (the jobs fired off by the
trigger is finished).</p>

<p>Job-related events include: a notification that the job is about to be executed,
and a notification when the job has completed execution.</p>

<p>To create a listener, simply create an object the implements either the
<i>org.quartz.TriggerListener</i> and/or <i>org.quartz.JobListener</i>  interface.
 Listeners are then registered with the scheduler during run time, and must be given
a name (or rather, they must advertise their own name via their <i>getName()</i>
method.  Listeners can be registered as either "global" or "non-global".  Global
listeners receive events for ALL triggers/jobs, and non-global listeners receive
events only for the specific triggers/jobs that explicitely name the listener in their
<i>getTriggerListenerNames()</i> or <i>getJobListenerNames()</i> properties.</p>
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  scheduler.addGlobalJobListener(myJobListener);
</font>
</pre>
or
<pre>
<font face="courier">
  scheduler.addJobListener(myJobListener);
</font>
</pre>

<p>Listeners are not used by most users of Quartz, but are handy when application
requirements create the need for the notification of events, without the Job itself explicitly
notifying the application.</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p><a name="schedListeners"/><font size="+1"><b>SchedulerListeners</b></font></p>

<p><i>SchedulerListeners</i> are much like TriggerListeners and JobListeners,
except they receive notification of events within the Scheduler itself - not necessarily
events related to a specific trigger or job.</p>

<p>Scheduler-related events include: the addition of a job/trigger, the removal of a job/trigger,
a serious error within the scheduler, notification of the scheduler being shutdown, and others.</p>

<p>SchedulerListeners are created and registered in much the same way as the other listener
types, except there is no distinction between global and non-global listeners.  SchedulerListeners
can be virtually any object that implements the <i>org.quartz.SchedulerListener</i> interface.</p>

<!-- JobStores                                                                   --------- -->

<p>JobStore's are responsible for keeping track of all the "work data" that
you give to the scheduler: jobs, triggers, calendars, etc.  Selecting the
appropriate <i>JobStore</i> for your Quartz scheduler instance is an
important step. Luckily, the choice should be a very easy one once you
understand the differences between them.  You declare which JobStore your
scheduler should use (and it's configuration settings) in the properties
file (or object) that you provide to the SchedulerFactory that you use to
produce your scheduler instance.</p>

<p>Note: Never use a JobStore instance directly in your code.  For some
reason many people attempt to do this.  The JobStore is for behind-the-scenes
use of Quartz itself.  You have to tell Quartz (through configuration) which
JobStore to use, but then you should only work with the Scheduler interface
in your code.</p>

<p><b>RAMJobStore</b></p>
<p><i>RAMJobStore</i> is the simplest JobStore to use, it is also the most
performant (in terms of CPU time).  RAMJobStore gets its name in the obvious
way: it keeps all of its data in RAM.  This is why it's lightning-fast, and
also why it's so simple to configure.  The drawback is that when your application
ends (or crashes) all of the scheduling information is lost - this means
RAMJobStore cannot honor the setting of "non-volatility" on jobs and triggers.
For some applications this is acceptable - or even the desired behavior, but for
other applications, this may be disasterous.</p>

<p>To use RAMJobStore (and assuming you're using StdSchedulerFactory) simply
specify the class name <i>org.quartz.simpl.RAMJobStore</i> as the JobStore class
property that you use to configure quartz:
<pre>
<font face="courier">
   org.quartz.jobStore.class = org.quartz.simpl.RAMJobStore
</font>
</pre>
There are no other settings you need to worry about.</p>

<br>
<p><b>JDBCJobStore</b></p>
<p><i>JDBCJobStore</i> is also aptly named - it keeps all of its data in
a database via JDBC.  Because of this it is a bit more complicated to
configure than RAMJobStore, and it also is not as fast.  However, the
performance draw-back is not terribly bad, especially if you build the
database tables with indexes on the primary keys. On a 800MHz Windoz box
running a Quartz application utilizing Oracle running on a on not-so-new
Solaris box, the time to retreive and update a firing trigger and its
associated job has been measured at about 15 milliseconds.</p>

<p>JDBCJobStore works with nearly any database, it has been used
widely with Oracle, MySQL, MS SQLServer2000, HSQLDB, PostreSQL and DB2.
To use JDBCJobStore, you must first create a set of database tables for
Quartz to use.  You can find table-creation SQL scripts in the "docs/dbTables"
directory of the Quartz distribution.  If there is not already a script for your
database type, just look at one of the existing ones, and modify it in any
way necessary for your DB.  One thing to note is that in these scripts, all
the the tables start with the prefix "QRTZ_" (such as the tables "QRTZ_TRIGGERS",
and "QRTZ_JOB_DETAIL").  This prefix can actually be anything you'd like,
as long as you inform JDBCJobStore what the prefix is (in your Quartz properties).
Using different prefixes may be useful for creating multiple sets of tables, for
multiple scheduler instances, within the same database.</p>

<p>Once you've got the tables created, you got one more major
decision to make before configuring and firing up JDBCJobStore.  You need
to decide what type of transactions your application needs.  If you aren't needing
to tie your scheduling commands (such as adding and removing triggers) to other
transactions, then you can let Quartz manage the transaction by using
JobStoreTX as your JobStore (this is the most common selection).</p>

<p> If you need Quartz to work along with other transactions (i.e. within a J2EE
application server), then you should use JobStoreCMT - in which case Quartz
will let the app server container mangage the transactions.</p>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is setting up a <i>DataSource</i> from which
JDBCJobStore can get connections to your database.  DataSources are defined
in your Quartz properties using one of a few different approaches.  One
approach is to have Quartz create and manage the DataSource itself - by providing
all of the connection information for the database. Another approach is to have Quartz use
a DataSource that is managed by an application server that Quartz is running inside of - by
providing JDBCJobStore the JNDI name of the DataSource.  For details on the properties,
consult the example config files in the "docs/config" folder.</p>

<p>To use JDBCJobStore (and assuming you're using StdSchedulerFactory) you first
need to set the JobStore class property of your Quartz configuration to be either
<i>org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreTX</i> or
<i>org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreCMT</i> - depending on the selection you
made based on the explanations in the above few paragraphs.</p>
<pre>
<font face="courier">
   org.quartz.jobStore.class = org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreTX
</font>
</pre>

<p>Next, you need to select a <i>DriverDelegate</i> for the JobStore to use.
The DriverDelegate is responsible for doing any JDBC work that may be needed
for your specific database.  <i>StdJDBCDelegate</i> is a delegate that uses
"vanilla" JDBC code (and SQL statements) to do its work.  If there isn't another
delegate made specifically for your database, try using this delgate - we've only
made database-specific delegates for databases that we've found problems using
StdJDBCDelegate with (which seems to be most ;-).  Other delegates can be found in
the "org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore" package, or in its sub-packages.  Other delegates include
<i>DB2v6Delegate</i> (for DB2 version 6 and earlier),  <i>HSQLDBDelegate</i> (for HSQLDB),
<i>MSSQLDelegate</i> (for microsoft SQLServer 2000), <i>PostgreSQLDelegate</i>
(for PostgreSQL 7.x), <i>WeblogicDelegate</i> (for using JDBC drivers made by
Weblogic), and <i>OracleDelegate</i> (for using Oracle 8i and 9i).</p>

<p>Once you've selected your delegate, set its class name as the delegate for
JDBCJobStore to use.</p>
<pre>
<font face="courier">
   org.quartz.jobStore.driverDelegateClass = org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.StdJDBCDelegate
</font>
</pre>

<p>Next, you need to inform the JobStore what table prefix (discussed above) you are using.</p>
<pre>
<font face="courier">
   org.quartz.jobStore.tablePrefix = QRTZ_
</font>
</pre>

<p>And finally, you need to set which <i>DataSource</i> should be used by the JobStore. The named
DataSource must also be defined in your Quartz properties.  In this case, we're specifying that Quartz
should use the DataSource name "myDS" (that is defined elsewhere in the configuration properties).</p>
<pre>
<font face="courier">
   org.quartz.jobStore.dataSource = myDS
</font>
</pre>

<p><i>Note:</i> If your Scheduler is very busy (i.e. nearly always executing the same number of jobs as
the size of the thread pool, then you should probably set the number of connections in the DataSource to
be the size of the thread pool + 1.</p>

<p>Quartz is architected in modular way, and therefore to get it running, several
components need to be "snapped" together.  Fortunately, some helpers exist for
making this happen.</p>

<p>Components that need to be configured before Quartz can do its thing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ThreadPool</li>
	<li>JobStore</li>
	<li>DataSources (if necessary)</li>
	<li>The Scheduler itself</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>ThreadPool</i> provides a set of Threads for Quartz to use when
executing Jobs.  The more threads in the pool, the greater number of Jobs that
can run concurrently.  However, too many threads may bog-down your system.
Most Quartz users find that 5 or so threads are plenty- because they have fewer
than 100 jobs at any given time, the jobs are not generally scheduled to run at
the same time, and the jobs are short-lived (complete quickly).  Other users find that
they need 10, 15, 50 or even 100 threads - because they have tens-of-thousands
of triggers with various schedules - which end up having an average of between
10 and 100 jobs trying to execute at any given moment.  Finding the right size for
your scheduler's pool is completely dependent on what you're using the scheduler
for.  There's no real rules, other than keep the number of threads as small as
possible (for the sake of your machine's resources) - but make sure you have
enough for your Jobs can fire on time.  Note that if a trigger's time to fire arrives,
and there isn't an available thread, Quartz will block (pause) until a thread comes
available, then the Job will execute - some number of milliseconds later than it
should have.</p>

<p>A ThreadPool interface is defined in the <i>org.quartz.spi</i> package, and
you can create a ThreadPool implementation in any way you like.  Quartz ships with
a simple (but very satisfactory) thread pool named <i>org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool</i>.
This ThreadPool simply maintains a fixed set of threads in its pool - never grows, never
shrinks.  But it is otherwise quite robust and is very well tested - as nearly everyone using
Quartz uses this pool.</p>

<p>The <i>JobStore</i> and <i>DataSrouces</i> were discussed in the "JobStores"
section of this document.  Worth noting here, is the fact that all JobStores implement
the <i>org.quartz.spi.JobStore</i> interface - and that if one of the bundled JobStores
does not fit your needs, then you can make your own.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to create your <i>Scheduler</i> instance.  The Scheduler itself
needs to be given an name, told its RMI settings, and handed instances of a JobStore
and ThreadPool.  The RMI settings include whether the Scheduler should create itself
as an RMI server object (make itself available to remote connections), what host and
port to use, etc..  StdSchedulerFactory (discussed below) can also produce Scheduler
instances that are actually proxies (RMI stubs) to Schedulers created in remote
processes.</p>

<br>
<p><b>StdSchedulerFactory</b></p>
<p><i>StdSchedulerFactory</i> is an implementation of the
<i>org.quartz.SchedulerFactory</i> interface.  It uses a set of properties
(<i>java.util.Properties</i>) to create and initialize a Quartz Scheduler.  The
properties are generally stored in and loaded from a file, but can also be created by
your program and handed directly to the factory.  Simply calling <i>getScheduler()</i>
on the factory will produce the scheduler, initialize it (and its ThreadPool, JobStore and
DataSources), and return a handle to its public interface.</p>

<p>There are some sample configurations (including full descriptions of the properties)
in the "docs/config" directory of the Quartz distribution.</p>


<br>
<p><b>DirectSchedulerFactory</b></p>
<p><i>DirectSchedulerFactory</i> is another SchedulerFactory  implementation.
It is useful to those wishing to create their Scheduler instance in a more programatic way.
Its use is generally discouraged for the following reasons:  (1) it requires the user to have
a greater understanding of what they're doing, and (2) it does not allow for declaritive
configuration - or in other words, you end up hard-coding all of the scheduler's settings.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Logging</b></p>
<p>Quartz uses the <i>org.apache.commons.logging</i> framework for all of its
logging needs.  Quartz does not produce much logging information - generally just
some information during initialization, and then only messages about serious problems
while Jobs are executing.  In order to "tune" the logging settings (such as the amount
of output, and where the output goes), you need to understand the
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging.html">Jakarta Commons Logging</a>
 framework, which is beyond the scope of this document.</p>

<p>By now you should have a fairly good understanding of what Quartz is and
what you can do with it.  If you're still rather confused, please contact the
project developer's via the
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/quartz">project development site</a>
and let us know how this document can be improved.</p>

<p><b>What Next?</b></p>
<p>If you haven't already looked at the example programs in the 'examples/'
directory of the distribution, you'll probably want to do that now.  After
you've done that, start playing around with Quartz yourself and read the
JavaDOC of the main 'client-side' components - which are found in the
"org.quartz" package.</p>

<br>
<p>PLEASE! - feel free to contribute to Quartz in any way that interests you.
Your feedback is always welcome - many of the current features and styles of
Quartz usage have come directly from users.  There's always plenty of
development work to be done, contact the project leaders if you are
interested.</p>
